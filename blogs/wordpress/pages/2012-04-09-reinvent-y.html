<p>I don't believe in the doctrine "Don't reinvent the wheels". I believe that one can never learn the essence of anything without reinventing it (intentionally or not). Once you reinvent a thing, you can never forget it --- because otherwise you can just reinvent it again.</p>

<p>Today I found that I forgot how to derive the definition of the Y combinator. I learned it several years ago from an online article, but now the search term "Y combinator" only brings news about startups (sigh). I attempted it for two hours, but still couldn't make the leap from the "poor man's Y" to "Y". Finally, I opened my good old friend "<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer">The Little Schemer</a>". Alas. Chapter 9 tells me exactly how to reinvent Y. Thank you Dan Friedman and Matthias Felleisen!</p>

<p>To prevent myself from forgetting how to derive Y again, I made a slide to record my understanding of it. It is slightly different from the ways of the recent version of "The Little Schemer", but I think it's easier to understand. I hope it can help some people (including the future me). So <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yinwang0/reinventing-the-ycombinator">here</a> it is.</p>

<p>Exercise: The Y combinator derived from this tutorial only works for direct recursion, try to derive the Y combinator for mutual recursive functions, for example the following two functions even and odd.</p>

<pre>
(define even
  (lambda (x)
    (cond
     [(zero? x) #t]
     [(= 1 x) #f]
     [else (odd (sub1 x))])))

(define odd
  (lambda (x)
    (cond
     [(zero? x) #f]
     [(= 1 x) #t]
     [else (even (sub1 x))])))
</pre>

                        </div>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </body>
