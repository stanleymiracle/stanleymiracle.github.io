<p>We all know that indexing into an array takes only O(1) time, while searching for a number in a sorted array takes O(n) time with linear search, and O(log n) time with binary search. But why is indexing so fast? What is the secret sauce?</p>

<p>The reason is really about the nature of indexing --- how it is implemented in a circuit. In order to illustrate this, let me show you an "addressing circuit".</p>

<p><a href="https://yinwang0.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/addressing-cuicuit.png"><img src="../imgs/addressing-cuicuit.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here, A and B are the two-bit address lines, they represent the indices: 00, 01, 10, 11. The output Z, Y, X and W are the selectors of the items in the array. Notice that an output selector is enabled only when both of the input lines of the corresponding AND gate is "1".</p>

<p>Now, ignore the input B and just look at A. See how its signal flows through the direct wires and the inverters. We can make the following observations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When A is "1", then the AND gate of X and W will receive a "1" on one of their input ports, while the AND gate of Z and Y will receive a "0" on one of their input puts.</li>
    <li>On the other hand, if A is "0", then the AND gate of X and W will receive a "0" on one of their input ports, while the AND gate of Z and Y will receive a "1" on one of their input puts.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the above, I hope you have seen that the value of A <em>partially selects</em> half of the AND gates --- it is either the set {X, W} or {Z, Y}. By "partially select", I mean they are not fully selected, because we haven't taken B into account. At this point, I hope you have noticed that A is in fact doing one step of a "binary search".</p>

<p>Now we do a similar thing, but this time focus on B and ignore A. You should see a similar thing: depending on the value of B, either we partially select {Y, W}, or we partially select {Z, X}. So we can also think of B as doing one step of a "binary search".</p>

<p>Now, we see that A and B are each a step of a binary search, and it is interesting to see that B's selection will cut A's selection evenly, whether A is 0 or 1. We can say the same thing vice versa: A's selection will cut B's selection evenly, whether A is 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Also notice that the selection of A and B can happen at the same time. That means, when they work simultaneously, it takes just O(1) for a binary search through an array of length 4. If we generalize this circuit to N bits of input, then within O(1) time, we can do a binary search through an array of length 2<sup>N</sup>.</p>

<p>This explains why indexing an array is faster than binary search, because it is a parallel binary search where (log n) steps happen at the same time.</p>
