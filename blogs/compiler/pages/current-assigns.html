<h3>1. Compile R_1 to x86 (Chapter 2)</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>2. Register Allocation (Chapter 3)</h3>
<p>Undergraduates implement sections 1 through 3 of Chapter 3 on register allocation.</p>
<p>Graduate students must also complete section 4, the challenge assignment on move biasing.</p>

<h3>3. Booleans and Control Flow (Chapter 4)</h3>
<p>Complete the exercises in Chapter 4, sections 1 through 10.</p>
<p>Graduate students must also complete the challenge in section 11.</p>

<h3>4. Tuples and Garbage Collection</h3>
<p>Add support for tuples and garbage collection to your compiler as described in Chapter 5 of the book.</p>

<h3>5. Functions</h3>
<p>Add support for functions to your compiler as described in Chapter 6 of the book.</p>

<h3>6. Lambda's</h3>
<p>Add support for lexically-scoped functions (lambda's) to your compiler as described in Chapter 7 of the book.</p>

<h3>7. Dynamic Typing</h3>
<p>Extend your compiler to support dynamic typing as described in Chapter 8 of the book.</p>

<h3>8. Project Proposal</h3>
<p>Write a 1-page description of your project.</p>

<h3>9. Final Project</h3>

<p>You final project will include a written report, the source code for your compiler (on github), and the tests for your compiler.</p>

<p>The written report should be 3-5 pages for undergraduates and 5-7 pages for graduate students. The report should include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What problem does your project solve? Or put another way, provide documentation to a hypothetical user of your compiler regarding what your project does for them, without discussing implementation details. Or put yet another way, what are the goals of your project? This part of your report could include example programs, syntax definitions, and definitional interpreters.</li>
	<li>How does your project solve the problem? Give an overview of your implementation and then discuss the most important details, which should include both the trickiest parts but also the most important parts in terms of having your implementation achieve its stated goals.</li>
	<li>Provide evidence that your project achieves its goals. This is called an "evaluation". Describe any tests, experiments, or reasoning that you have conducted to evaluate whether your implementation meets your stated goals.</li>
	<li>Clearly describe which goals have been achieved at the time of turning in your project and which goals were unfinished.</li>
</ul>
