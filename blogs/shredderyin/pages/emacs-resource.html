       "Richard Stallman (aka RMS), The saint of free software"

          ... But Stallman just doesn't care about pragmatic arguments -
          he declares he would prefer to use a free software program even
          if it wasn't the best solution for his needs. His stance makes
          some factions of the burgeoning "open source" community
          uncomfortable - so uncomfortable, in fact, that the very choice
          of the name "open source" demonstrates an attempt to distance
          those factions from the unsavory radicalism of Richard Stallman
          ..."The reason I care especially," said Stallman, "is that there
          is a philosophy associated with the GNU project"

          ...Last week, I profiled Richard Stallman, a central figure in the
          ongoing saga of the free software movement. Within minutes of the
          publication of the story, "The saint of free software," my
          e-mailbox began filling up with a provocative outpouring from
          Stallman's colleagues, friends and enemies.

       "An Ode to Richard Stallman"
        Linux Gazette issue #37 1999-02 By Stephen Adler &lt;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0766636b62754765696b29606871">[email&#160;protected]</a>&gt;.

        <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue37/adler.html">http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue37/adler.html</a>

          ...Jay begins. He tells us a story about how the free software
          movement started with Richard. Back some time ago at the MIT
          software labs, Richard was trying to print to some ding doing
          printer and couldn't. There was a software bug which stood
          between him and his printout. Richard wanted to solve the problem
          by getting the source code and fixing it. He couldn't, the source
          code was not available and more important, could not be made
          available because the company who sold MIT the printer would not
          hand over the code. The code was locked up behind legal doors and
          Stallman was not going to be able to solve this problem. Thus the
          beginning of the free software movement which has evolved into
          what we know today.

          ...[Stallman] The free software effort is about freedom, not
          software which costs nothing. A freedom which goes beyond source
          code and into the way we interact as a community. Free software
          is a manifestation of this freedom and is an example of it. I
          think it's best to see this in the opposite sense. When you are
          encumbered with software which you cannot change, even if you
          have the source code in front of you but are not allowed legally
          to change and distribute the changes, then your personal,
          inherent freedom has been taken from you.

    2.4 Jokes

       2.4.1 The Word Emacs

        In the early days, when memory was tight and machines slow people
        got upset how much memory Emacs used. And it still uses all the
        memory it can get if you use GNUS with unlimited cache setting. You
        heard this a lot back then. And no wonder Emacs uses so many key
        combinations, because Emacs is actually.... [this is from Gnus
        manual...] What the word in reality means, is explained in the
        Emacs FAQ. See also the Emacs distribution and file `etc/JOKES'.

            Q: What does the word "EMACS mean again?"
            A: "Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping"

       2.4.2 New commands in Emacs

          2000-12-03 gnu.emacs.help thread under subject "Re: Gnu Emacs
          21?", participating writers Eli Zaretskii, Andre Spiegel, Stefan
          Monnier, Kai Gro?johann and the answering guy: Per Abrahamsen

   I need to graduate sometime

        With sufficient Emacs training, you will gain access to command:
        M-x write-thesis RET

   Err... I cannot find that in the manual... What does this command
   do when invoked with a prefix argument? I am also confused about
   the implementation of this command. How is the interaction
   between the supervisor and student simulated in lisp? And what
   function does emacs use to emulate extracting that last chapter
   before the deadline from the student, and the student getting the
   supervisor to actually read the damn thing. I tried an apropos
   search for "thesis-blood-from-stone" but got nothing....

        Without a prefix argument, it writes a master's thesis. You get a
        PhD thesis when you invoke it with a prefix argument, and as far as
        I recall, the quality of the resulting work can somehow be tuned by
        using numeric arguments. However, to avoid flooding the libraries
        on earth, I have heard that the command can only be invoked exactly
        once per user.

   Yes. You can imagine my dismay when I accidentally typed `M-x'
   `write-thesis' `RET' rather than the intended `M-x' `write-the-sis'
   `RET'. Perhaps when 21 is released I will get another shot. It is
   simply crushing to think I may have to write a thesis the
   old-fashioned way.

        Don't just whine about it here! Submit a bug report with M-x
        report-emacs-bug RET If you find some point of the documentation
        lacking or unclear. How do you expect the Emacs documentation ever
        to improve if the users are too lazy to even report the bugs and
        deficits they encounter? Sheesh, kids these days, they expect
        everything to be prepared for them, and have no sense of giving
        back! When *I* was young, we didn't ask what Emacs could do for us.
        We asked what we could do for Emacs. Kids of today could learn *a
        lot* from that! What does this command do when invoked with a
        prefix argument?

   What does the command do if you call it programmatically?

        Writes multiple theses, of course. What did you expect? Please read
        tutorial (type `C-h' `t') before bothering with such elementary
        questions. Each message costs the net hundreds if not thousands of
        dollars.

        (Poor fellow replied...) And you there, yes, you man. Don't attempt
        to answer a question when you obviously haven't a clue. Maybe you
        "tested" the command, and it did as you said, but that is just an
        accident. The type of thesis generated depends on 1) the previous
        generated thesis[1], and 2) an examination of the content of all
        the files the user have opened with Emacs[2]. It is not like the
        command is magic or anything.

        _Footnotes:_ [1] So if the previous generated thesis was a
        Master Thesis, the next will default to a PhD. Thesis. [2] So use
        W3 to read as many relevant online articles as possible, before
        invoking the command. And *don't* browse for porn unless that is
        what you want to graduate in.

   What a stupid user interface. Maybe you elders were content with
   something like that, but it is certainly not the type of thing
   users would expect in the 21st century. I bow before the
   enormous wisdom that must have gone into M-x write-thesis, but
   we need to find a way to use it effectively.

   What if I need to write multiple Master's Theses before embarking
   on my first PhD? And what if I write multiple PhD theses, and
   then again, a Master's Thesis to qualify for yet another PhD?
   Clearly, these possibilities weren't considered at all when
   designing the user interface of M-x write-thesis; you elders were
   content with that simplistic default mode (and DON'T tell me that
   I just need to hack a few lisp expressions to get what I want.
   I'm not attempting to write a PhD about EMACS, and besides I've
   got other things to do than spending hours or even days for
   writing a thesis!).

        When Emacs prompt you with: Thesis level (default `Master'):
        press TAB to see a list of available choices, then type the name
        of the one you prefer. You can use TAB to complete the answer
        after typing a unique prefix, or (I know you young ones love this)
        choose an answer by clicking the middle button while the mouse
        pointer is above the answer in the *Completions* buffer. If you
        don't have a mouse and are afraid to type, you can even switch to
        the *Completions* buffer, move the cursor to the answer, and press
        RET to select it. Isn't that amazing!

   I don't see how using the prefix argument to write multiple
   theses makes any sense at all. By what do these theses differ,
   then? They are all based on the currently loaded buffers, no? So
   am I supposed to actually READ them and find out which I like
   most or what?

   And what if I write multiple PhD theses, and then again, a
   Master's Thesis to qualify for yet another PhD?
   I suggest using the prefix argument to distinguish between a
   Master's Thesis and a PhD Thesis, period. Very simple, very easy
   to understand. Just a pity that this change won't make it into
   Emacs 21.1 anymore, as we're already too late in the pretest.

        This would make it inconsistent with `self-insert-command'. Or do
        you propose that `self-insert-command' should be modified as well,
        so the prefix argument changes the inserted character? I can see it
        now, `C-u' `2' `i' inserts `k', `C-u' `-' `2' `i' inserts `g'.
        _Another_ _choice:_ Switch to *XEmacs*, and you'll have it. The
        code has been written since Emacs 18.62, but GNU refused to accept
        it because `M-x' `write-thesis' won't print the standard GPL blurb
        before the thesis and the assignment paper after it...

   I wonder how do I choose between *roff and LaTeX as the thesis
   format? Hm. [time passes] Ah, see the variable
   `write-thesis-format'.

        Just a warning, it doesn't work if you set it directly. Either call
        `set-thesis-format' from your .emacs, or set the variable with
        Customize.

   [Q1] All this stuff seems to be very complicated to a beginner like
   me. Anybody can send me some code to put a easily accessible menu
   option to write my thesis? I don't see the point in spend time
   learning new key-combos and writing things only to write my
   thesis. Just two mouse clicks should be enough (or one, with the
   new buttons of the GNU Emacs 21).

   [Q2] I remember a neat hack floating around that allowed you to
   specify the subject with a prefix argument, in case you've
   browsed too much crappy sites. But _deja_ of course doesn't have
   the article any more. Anybody still has it somewhere ?

        Prefix argument... sigh. Not me, but the _standard_ thesis
        package has `thesis-ignored-buffers', which is a regexp of buffer
        names that will be ignored when writing the thesis.

       "Why GNU?"_

        <a href="http://www.mandrakeforum.com/article.php3?sid=20001222092909">http://www.mandrakeforum.com/article.php3?sid=20001222092909</a>
        Article by Denis Havlik &lt;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="593d3c37302a193438373d2b38323c2a363f2d773a3634">[email&#160;protected]</a>&gt; published under

          "First part of the speech was "why did I start GNU project" info.
          Official RMS biography only says: Stallman graduated from Harvard
          in 1974 with a BA in physics. During his college years, he also
          worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab,
          learning operating system development by doing it. He wrote the
          first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1975. In January 1984
          he resigned from MIT to start the GNU Project. Without stating
          the REASON why he left the MIT lab and started GNU project."

          "When Richard M. Stallman started his programmers career, world
          of programming was much different from what it looks like today:
          back then, ND-agreements and shrink-wrap licenses simply didn't
          exist, and sharing code was considered normal behavior. Then
          someone came to idea that he can make a lot of money by NOT
          sharing the source code, and started the avalanche which
          ultimately led to Single-click patent and UCITA. The form in
          which RMS first encountered this brave new world for the first
          time was somewhat bizarre: Xerox donated a laser printer to the
          MIT lab he worked in, and this printer was controlled by
          proprietary software. This printer was great, but it often
          jammed, and "no source" meant that they had no way of
          implementing the "printer jammed" warning as they did for other
          printers, used in the lab. As you can imagine, walking up and
          down or camping next to printer turned out into a somewhat
          annoying experience... Worse yet, some time later, Stallman
          actually met a college which had source code of printer
          controlling software, and refused to share it because he signed
          the NDA! Instead of accepting this bizarre situation as "normal",
          RMS turned around, quit the job at MIT and started the GNU
          project. (the rest is a history)"

        location unknown, so the text has been copied here.

        _About_ _Guy_ _L._ _Steele_ _Jr._ Guy L. Steele Jr. is a
        Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, Inc. He received his
        A.B. in applied mathematics from Harvard College (1975), and his
        S.M. and Ph.D. in computer science and artificial intelligence from
        M.I.T. (1977 and 1980). He has also been an assistant professor of
        computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University; a member of
        technical staff at Tartan Laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;
        and a senior scientist at Thinking Machines Corporation. He joined
        Sun Microsystems in 1994.

        He is author or co-author of five books: Common Lisp: The Language
        (Digital Press); C: A Reference Manual (Prentice-Hall); The
        Hacker's Dictionary (Harper &amp; Row), which has been revised as The
        New Hacker's Dictionary, edited by Eric Raymond with introduction
        and illustrations by Guy Steele (MIT Press); The High Performance
        Fortran Handbook (MIT Press); and The Java Language Specification
        (Addison-Wesley).

        He has published more than two dozen papers on the subject of the
        Lisp language and Lisp implementation, including a series with
        Gerald Jay Sussman that defined the Scheme dialect of Lisp. One of
        these, "Multiprocessing Compactifying Garbage Collection," won
        first place in the ACM 1975 George E. Forsythe Student Paper
        Competition. Other papers published in Communications of the ACM
        are "Design of a LISP-Based Microprocessor" with Gerald Jay Sussman
        (November 1980) and "Data Parallel Algorithms" with W. Daniel
        Hillis (December 1986). He has also published papers on other
        subjects, including compilers, parallel processing, and constraint
        languages. One song he composed has been published in CACM ("The
        Telnet Song", April 1984).

        The Association for Computing Machinery awarded him the 1988 Grace
        Murray Hopper Award and named him an ACM Fellow in 1994. He was
        elected a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial
        Intelligence in 1990. He led the team that received a 1990 Gordon
        Bell Prize honorable mention for achieving the fastest speed to
        that date for a production application: 14.182 Gigaflops. He was
        also awarded the 1996 ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement
        Award.

        He has served on accredited standards committees X3J11 (C language)
        and X3J3 (Fortran) and is currently chairman of X3J13 (Common
        Lisp). He was also a member of the IEEE committee that produced the
        IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language, IEEE Std
        1178-1990. He represents Sun Microsystems in the High Performance
        Fortran Forum, which produced the High Performance Fortran
        specification in May, 1993.

        He has served on Ph.D. thesis committees for eight students. He has
        served as program chair for the 1984 ACM Lisp Conference and for
        the 15th ACM POPL conference (1988) and 23rd ACM POPL conference
        (1996); he also served on program committees for 30 other
        conferences. He served a five-year term on the ACM Turing Award
        committee, chairing it in 1990. He served a five-year term on the
        ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award committee, chairing it in 1992.

        He has had chess problems published in Chess Life and Review and is
        a Life Member of the United States Chess Federation. He has sung in
        the bass section of the MIT Choral Society (John Oliver, conductor)
        and the Masterworks Chorale (Allen Lannom, conductor) as well as in
        choruses with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at Great Woods
        (Michael Tilson Thomas, conductor) and with the Boston Concert
        Opera (David Stockton, conductor). He has played the role of Lun
        Tha in The King and I and the title role in Li'l Abner.

        He designed the original EMACS command set and was the first
        person to port TeX.

        At Sun Microsystems he is  responsible for research in language
        design and implementation strategies, and architectural and
        software support, and for the specification of the Java programming
        language.

    2.8 Emacs or XEmacs future plans

        There has been talk on making `let' to work like in modern
        languages, i.e. binding variables locally(lexical scoping), and
        making Elisp mode line Common Lisp, possibly replacing Elisp
        altogether. It's big a task and won't happen soon, but it is on the
        sketch board.

          [Comment from the DING-L] ...Scary.
          manipulate a buffer in Perl, you either have to call
          the lisp routines, or use buffer-string to convert the buffer to
          a string that Perl can use, which is ... icky. But what worries
          me more is I'm not clear on how safe the wedding is. like, I
          don't know if things work right if you 'die' out of a Perl
          function called from a lisp function called from a Perl function.
          and the intertwined garbage collection is a mess.

          [Eric Marsden] I was the technical editor for this book. However,
          I don't get paid anything per book sold. The book is very
          approachable and readable in style, as you'll expect if you've
          read Larry Ayers' articles in the online Linux Gazette.
          Downside: it's more linux-specific than necessary in some places
          (probably for marketing reasons). Why buy the book given that
          the Emacs manuals are excellent? The style is different, probably
          easier to read and navigate for beginners. There are many tips,
          hints, screenshots, code snippets which you won't find in the
          manual, which is more a reference guide. And the book covers many
          modules which aren't described in the manuals. Given that it has
          around 550 pages, it can go into quite a lot of detail, including

        o   history of Emacs and the free software movement
        o   Motivation of the utility of an extensible editor
        o   intro to Customize
        o   notions of elisp, including dissection of an add-on module
        o   how to install packages (sections for Emacs and XEmacs)
        o   discussion of several builtin packages: bookmarks, ediff etc
        o   intro to VM, ange-ftp/EFS, w3, doctor, great chapter on Gnus
        o   where to find help (manual, C-h keys, apropos, USENET)
        o   CD with Emacs and XEmacs source and binaries, doc, add-on
            modules

          people who need to really customize their Emacs and is therefore
          meant for advanced users.

          book for anyone who knows programming, but doesn't know Lisp or
          how it can be used with Emacs. It starts by teaching a few simple
          skills for finding out what functions are bound to what keys (and
          how), and then goes into making minor modifications to existing
          functionality by hooking functions. It goes through a light
          introduction to Lisp, and then dives into Minor and Major Modes.
          It winds up with a long chapter describing the development of a
          substantial major mode. Appendices include a Lisp quick
          reference, tips on debugging and profiling code, how to package
          and share code, and how to obtain and compile Emacs.

          The writing is stream of consciousness, but is tightly focused on
          specific topics, and has the feel of looking over someone's
          shoulder as they explore Emacs at the keyboard. Many footnotes
          and asides give "try it yourself" tidbits that show the commands
          used to test Emacs and get information from it. During the
          development of code, a simple attempt is made and then critiqued,
          resulting in the introduction of a more refined method for
          accomplishing the same thing. Each chapter builds on the last,
          and is fairly quickly paced. Very few words are wasted.

          For old hands at writing packages like efs and w3, this book
          would not add anything to what you already know. Also: While it
          is specifically focused on Emacs, it speaks well to those us who
          use XEmacs; the focus of the book is Lisp code, and how to modify
          Emacs with it, not graphics, X, or specific packages. I've been
          waiting for a recently written book on Emacs to be published by
          O' Reilly and Associates for a long time. I'm glad I picked this
          one up.

          This is a fine book and is worth every penny IMHO. If you plan to
          only *use* Emacs without any Lisp hacking just stick with this
          one. Very good for beginners and advanced users.

          worth, I agree more with the first writer than the second; that
          is, I think that Learning GNU Emacs is a decent book. I bought
          the first edition, and have not purchased the second edition. The
          first edition really dealt with GNU Emacs in the 18.55-59 time
          frame. Admittedly, many user interface issues have changed.
          Still, even today, the first edition is a useful tool to learn
          the basics of Emacs. I cannot speak for the second edition, but I
          suspect that it is already quite out of date, given the recent
          changes to customization. As far as Elisp code, it is true,
          Cameron and Rosenblatt (and now Raymond?) are not expert Lisp or
          Emacs Lisp coders. Their simple examples are adequate; for more
          complicated extensions, I think the other text, about Writing GNU
          Emacs Extensions, is a more appropriate source. Like others, I
          recommend the FSF texts as the definitive resources, particularly
          when it comes to Emacs Lisp.

        In the download site, *barebin* has just the .exe's and a few other
        files, and is only useful in conjunction with the "src" tarball.
        This gives you the full source to everything, if you happen to want
        that. *bin* is usable by itself, but doesn't include the elisp
        source (that is provided by the "lisp" tarball). If you know you
        want the elisp source, you can just get "fullbin", which is
        basically "bin+lisp". *leim* is the Library of Emacs Input Methods,
        which is only of interest if you want to enter non-ascii characters

        [Cygwin-L 2000-07-28 Rod Whitby] XEmacs 21.1.10, 21.2.34 and
        21.2.35 have all compiled out of the box for me with Cygwin 1.1.2
        and the pre-release 1.1.3, using the following configure line for
        Cygwin. There is one small problem with building 21.2.35 where
        src/xemacs.exe is not getting the executable bit set during the
        build (when dumped from temacs.exe). Just "chmod ugo+x
        src/xemacs.exe", and type make again.

            ./configure --with-x=no --site-includes=/usr/local/include \
            --site-libraries=/usr/local/lib --with-dragndrop

            ./configure  \
            --with-mule \
