                <p class="source">Suprise? Of course I was surprised. You go out with a girl. First date, second date, a restaurant here, a movie there, always just matinees. You start sleeping together, the sex is mind-blowing, and pretty soon there's feeling too. And then, one day, she shows up in tears, and you hug her and tell her to take it easy, everything's going to be OK, and she says she can't stand it anymore, she has this secret, not just a secret, something really awful, a curse, something she's been wanting to tell you from the beginning but she didn't have the guts. This thing, it's been weighing her down, and now she's got to tell you, she's simply got to, but she knows that as soon as she does, you'll leave her, and you'll be absolutely right to leave her, too. And then she starts crying all over again.</p>
                <p class="translate">惊讶吗？ 我当然很惊讶。 你和一个女孩出去。 第一次约会，第二次约会，这里一家餐馆，那里一场电影，总是只有日场。 你们开始睡在一起，性爱令人兴奋，很快也有了感觉。 然后有一天，她泪流满面地出现，你拥抱她，告诉她别紧张，一切都会好起来的，她说她再也受不了了，她有这个秘密，不仅仅是一个秘密 ，某些非常可怕的事情，一个诅咒，一些她从一开始就想告诉你的事情，但她没有勇气。 这件事，一直压在她的心头，现在她必须告诉你，她只是必须告诉你，但她知道，一旦她这么做，你就会离开她，而且你离开她也是绝对正确的 。 然后她又开始哭了。</p>

                <p>"I won't leave you," you tell her. "I won't. I love you." You try to look concerned, but you're not. Not really. Or rather, if you are concerned, it's about her crying, not about her secret. You know by now that these secrets that always make a women fall to pieces are usually something along the lines of doing it with an animal, or a Mormon, or with someone who paid her for it. "I'm a whore," they always wind up saying. And you hug them and say, "no you're not. You're not." And if they don't stop crying all you can do is say "<i>shhh</i>".</p>
                <p class="translate">“我不会离开你，”你告诉她。 “我不会。我爱你。” 你试图表现出关心的样子，但事实并非如此。 并不真地。 或者更确切地说，如果你担心的话，那是因为她的哭泣，而不是她的秘密。 你现在知道了，这些总是让女人崩溃的秘密通常是与动物、摩门教徒或付钱给她的人做的事情。 “我是个妓女，”他们总是这样说。 然后你拥抱他们并说：“不，你不是。你不是。” 如果他们不停止哭泣，你所能做的就是说“嘘”。</p>

                <p>"It's something really terrible," she insists, as if she's picked up on how <abbr class="abbr" data-text="(of a person or manner) feeling or appearing casually calm and relaxed; not displaying anxiety, interest, or enthusiasm.">nonchalant</abbr> you are about it, even though you've tried to hide it. "In the pit of your stomach it may sound terrible," you tell her, "but that's just acoustics. As soon as you let it out it won't seem anywhere near as bad — you'll see."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这真的很可怕，”她坚持说，仿佛她发现了你对此的漠不关心，尽管你试图隐藏它。 “在你的胃里，这听起来可能很糟糕，”你告诉她，“但这只是声音。一旦你把它发出来，它看起来就不会那么糟糕了 —— 你会看到的。”</p>

                <p>And she almost believes you. She hesitates and then she asks: "What if I told you that at night I turn into a heavy, hairy man, with no neck, with a gold ring on his pinkie, would you still love me?" And you tell her of course you would. What else can you say? That you wouldn't? She's just trying to test you, to see whether you love her unconditionally — and you've always been a winner at tests.</p>
                <p class="translate">她几乎相信你了。 她犹豫了一下，然后问道：“如果我告诉你，到了晚上我会变成一个胖乎乎、毛茸茸的男人，没有脖子，小指上戴着金戒指，你还会爱我吗？” 你告诉她你当然会的。 你还能说什么？ 你不会吗？ 她只是想考验你，看看你是否无条件地爱她 —— 而你一直是考验的胜利者。</p>

                <p>In fact, as soon as you say it, she melts, and you do it, right there in the living room. And afterward, you lie there holding each other tight, and she cries because she's so relieved, and you cry too. Go figure. And unlike all the other times, she doesn't get up and go. She stays there and falls asleep. And you lie awake, looking at her beautiful body, at the sunset outside, at the moon appearing as if out of nowhere, at the silvery light flickering over her body, stroking the hair on her back.</p>
                <p class="translate">事实上，你一说出来，她就会融化，而你就在客厅里这么做了。 然后，你们躺在那里，紧紧地拥抱在一起，她哭了，因为她如释重负，你也哭了。 去搞清楚。 与其他时候不同的是，她没有起身走开。 她呆在那里睡着了。 你醒着地躺着，看着她美丽的身体，看着外面的日落，看着不知从哪里出现的月亮，看着她身上闪烁的银光，抚摸着她背上的头发。</p>

                <p>And within five minutes you find yourself lying next to this guy — this short fat guy. And the guy gets up and smiles at you, and awkwardly gets dressed. He leaves the room and you follow him, <abbr class="abbr" data-text="hold the complete attention of (someone) as though by magic; fascinate.">spellbound</abbr>. He's in the den now, his thick fingers fiddling with the remote, zapping to the sports channels. Championship soccer. When they miss a pass, he curses the TV; when they score, he gets up and does a little victory dance.</p>
                <p class="translate">五分钟之内，你发现自己躺在这个家伙旁边 —— 这个矮胖的家伙。 那家伙站起来对你微笑，然后笨拙地穿好衣服。 他离开了房间，你跟着他，神魂颠倒。 他现在在书房里，粗大的手指摆弄着遥控器，调到体育频道。 冠军足球。 当他们传球失败时，他就会咒骂电视； 当他们得分时，他站起来跳一小段胜利之舞。</p>

                <p>After the game he tells you that his throat is dry and his stomach is growling. He could really use a beer and a big steak. Welldone if possible, and with lots of onion rings, but he'd settle for pork chops. So you get in the car and take him to this restaurant that he knows about. This new twist has you worried, it really does, but you have no idea what you should do. Your command-and-control centers are down. You shift gears at the exit, in a daze. He's right there beside you in the passenger seat, tapping that gold-ringed pinkie of his. At the next intersection, he rolls down his window, winks at you, and yells at a girl who's trying to thumb a ride: "Hey, baby, wanna play nanny goat and ride in the back?"</p>
                <p class="translate">比赛结束后，他告诉你他的喉咙很干，肚子咕咕叫。 他真的需要一杯啤酒和一块大牛排。 如果可能的话，全熟，还有很多洋葱圈，但他会选择猪排。 于是你上车带他去了他知道的这家餐馆。 这个新的转折让你担心，确实如此，但你不知道自己应该做什么。 你的指挥和控制中心瘫痪了。 你在出口处换档，神情恍惚。 他就在你旁边的乘客座位上，轻拍着他那只戴着金戒指的小指。 在下一个十字路口，他摇下车窗，向你眨眼，并对一个试图搭便车的女孩大喊：“嘿，宝贝，想扮演保姆山羊并骑在后面吗？”</p>

                <p>Later, the two of you pack in the steak and the chops and the onion rings till you're about to explode, and he enjoys every bite, and laughs like a baby. And all that time you keep telling yourself it's got to be a dream. A bizarre dream, yes, but definitely one that you'll snap out of any minute.</p>
                <p class="translate">后来，你们两个把牛排、排骨和洋葱圈吃进去，直到你们快要爆炸了，他每一口都很享受，笑得像个婴儿。 一直以来，你都不断告诉自己这一定是一个梦。 是的，这是一个奇怪的梦，但绝对是一个你随时都会惊醒的梦。</p>

                <p>On the way back, you ask him where he'd like you to drop him off, and he pretends not to hear you, but he looks despondent. So you wind up taking him home. "It's almost three a.m. I'm hitting the sack," you tell him, and he waves his hand, and stays in the beanbag chair, staring at the fashion channel. You wake up the next moring, exhausted, and your stomach hurts. And there she is, in the living room, still <abbr class="abbr" data-text="sleep lightly">dozing</abbr>. But by the time you've had your shower, she's up. She gives you a <abbr class="abbr" data-text="(of a person or expression) showing embarrassment from shame or a lack of self-confidence.">sheepish</abbr> hug, and you're too embarrassed to say anything.</p>
                <p class="translate">回来的路上，你问他想让你在哪里放他下车，他假装没听见，但看上去很沮丧。 所以你最终带他回家。 “快凌晨三点了，我要睡觉了，”你告诉他，他挥挥手，坐在懒人沙发上，盯着时尚频道。 第二天早上你醒来时，精疲力尽，而且胃疼。 她就在客厅里，还在打瞌睡。 但当你洗完澡的时候，她就起来了。 她羞涩地拥抱了你，而你却不好意思说什么。</p>

                <p>Time goes by and you're still together. The sex just gets better and better. She's not so young anymore, and neither are you, and suddenly you find yourselves talking about a baby. And at night, you and fatso hit the town like you've never done in your life. He takes you to restaurants and bars you didn't even know existed, and you dance on the tables together, and break plates like there's no tomorrow. He's really nice, the fatso, a little <abbr class="abbr" data-text="lacking sensitivity, refinement, or intelligence.">crass</abbr>, especially with women; sometimes the things he comes out with make you want to sink into the floor. Other than that, he's lots of fun.</p>
                <p class="translate">时间流逝，你们还在一起。 性爱变得越来越好。 她不再年轻了，你们也不再年轻了，突然你们发现自己在谈论婴儿。 晚上，你和胖子以你一生中从未做过的方式进城。 他带你去你甚至不知道存在的餐馆和酒吧，你们一起在桌子上跳舞，打破盘子，就像没有明天一样。 他是个非常好的胖子，但有点粗鲁，尤其是对女人来说； 有时候他拿出来的东西会让你想陷进地板里。 除此之外，他还很有趣。</p>

                <p>When you first met him, you didn't give a damn about soccer, but now you know every team. And whenever one of your favorites wins, you feel like you've made a wish and it's come true. Which is a pretty exceptional feeling for someone like you, who hardly knows what he wants most of the time. And so it goes: every night you fall asleep with him struggling to stay awake for the Argentinean finals, and in the morning there she is, the beautiful, forgiving woman who you love, too, till it hurts.</p>
                <p class="translate">当你第一次见到他时，你根本不关心足球，但现在你了解每支球队。 每当你最喜欢的球队获胜时，你都会感觉自己已经许下了一个愿望，而且它已经实现了。 对于像你这样大多数时候几乎不知道自己想要什么的人来说，这是一种非常特别的感觉。 事情就是这样：每天晚上你都睡着了，他在阿根廷决赛中努力保持清醒，而早上她就在那里，你也爱着那个美丽、宽容的女人，直到心痛。</p>
