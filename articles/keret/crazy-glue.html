                <h1>Crazy Glue 疯狂的胶水</h1>
                <div class="author">Etgar Keret</div>
                <p class="source">She said, “Don't touch that.”</p>
                <p class="translate">她说，“别碰”</p>
                <p class="source">“What is it?” I asked.</p>
                <p class="translate">“那是啥？” 我问道。</p>
                <p class="source">“It's glue,” she said. “Special glue. The best kind.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“是胶水，” 她说。“特殊的胶水。最好的那种。”</p>
                <p class="source">“What did you buy it for?”</p>
                <p class="translate">“你买它干啥？”</p>
                <p class="source">“Because I need it,” she said. “A lot of things around here need gluing.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“因为我需要它，” 她说。“这里的很多东西都需要粘合。”</p>
                <p class="source">“Nothing around here needs gluing,” I said. “I wish I understood why you buy all this stuff.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“这里没啥需要粘合的，” 我说。“我希望我能懂为何你要买这些东西。”</p>
                <p class="source">“For the same reason I married you,” she murmured. “To help pass the time.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“就像我嫁给你一样，” 她喃喃道。“为了打发时间。”</p>
                <p class="source">I didn't want to fight, so I kept quiet, and so did she.</p>
                <p class="translate">我不想吵架，因此保持了安静，她也一样。</p>
                <p class="source">“Is it any good, this glue?” I asked. She showed me the picture on the box, with this guy hanging upside-down from the ceiling.</p>
                <p class="translate">“这胶水，好用吗？” 我问。她给我看了盒子上的图，一个家伙从天花板上倒挂着。</p>
                <p class="source">“No glue can really make a person stick like that,” I said. “They just took the picture upside-down. They must have put a light fixture on the floor.” I took the box from her and peered at it. “And there, look at the window. They didn't even bother to hang the blinds the other way. They're upside-down, if he's really standing on the ceiling. Look,” I said again, pointing to the window. She didn't look.</p>
                <p class="translate">“不可能有胶水能那样把人粘住，” 我说。“他们只是把图片倒转了。他们肯定在地上固定了个假灯。” 我从她那儿拿过图凝视着。“那里，看那个窗户。他们甚至懒得把百叶窗倒过来。它们是翻转的，如果那个家伙真的站在了天花板的话。快看。” 我指着窗户又说道。她看也没看。</p>
                <p class="source">“It's 8 already,” I said. “I've got to run.” I picked up my briefcase and kissed her on the cheek. “I'll be back pretty late. I'm working –”</p>
                <p class="translate">“已经8点了，” 我说。“我要赶紧走了。” 我拿起我的公文包并在她脸颊上亲了一口。“我会晚点回来。我要...”</p>
                <p class="source">“Overtime,” she said. “Yes, I know.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“加班嘛，” 她说。“是的，我知道。”</p>
                <p class="source">I called Abby from the office.</p>
                <p class="translate">我从办公室打电话给Abby</p>
                <p class="source">“I can't make it today,” I said. “I've got to get home early.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“我今天去不了了，” 我说。“我要早点回家了。”</p>
                <p class="source">“Why?” Abby asked. “Something happen?”</p>
                <p class="translate">“为什么？” Abby问道。“发生了什么吗？”</p>
                <p class="source">“No . . . I mean, maybe. I think she suspects something.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“没有...我是说，可能吧。我觉得她起疑了。”</p>
                <p class="source">There was a long silence. I could hear Abby's breathing on the other end.</p>
                <p class="translate">那是一段长长的寂静。我都能在电话那头听见Abby的呼吸声了。</p>
                <p class="source">“I don't see why you stay with her,” she whispered. “You never do anything together. You don't even fight. I'll never understand it.” There was a pause, and then she repeated, “I wish I understood.” She was crying.</p>
                <p class="translate">“我不明白你为什么和她在一起，” 她低声说道。“你们从来都不一起干任何事。你们甚至都不吵架。我从来都不懂。” 一会静止后，她重复道，“我希望我能懂。” 她哭了。</p>
                <p class="source">“I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Abby. Listen, someone just came in,” I lied. “I've got to hang up. I'll come over tomorrow. I promise. We'll talk about everything then.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“对不起。对不起，Abby。听着，有人进来了，” 我撒谎道，“我要挂了。我明天会过去。我保证。我们会就所有的事都谈一谈。”</p>
                <p class="source">I got home early. I said “Hi” as I walked in, but there was no reply. I went through all the rooms in the house. She wasn't in any of them. On the kitchen table I found the tube of glue, completely empty. I tried to move one of the chairs, to sit down. It didn't budge. I tried again. Not an inch. She'd glued it to the floor. The fridge wouldn't open. She'd glued it shut. I didn't understand what was happening, what would make her do such a thing. I didn't know where she was. I went into the living room to call her mother's. I couldn't lift the receiver; she'd glued that too. I kicked the table and almost broke my toe.</p>
                <p class="translate">我早早地回到了家里。我边进去边说了声“Hi”，但没有人回应。我到屋里的每间房都去了一遍。她没在任何一间里。在厨房的桌上我找到一管胶水，被完全用空了。我试着挪了下椅子，想坐下。它一动也不动。我再试了试。它一寸也不动。她把它粘到了地板上。冰箱也打不开。她把它粘死了。我不明白发生了什么，是什么让她这么做的。我都不知道她在哪。我去到客厅想给她母亲打个电话。电话筒我都拎不起来；那东西也被她粘住了。我踢了一脚桌子，差点没把脚趾踢断。</p>
                <p class="source">And then I heard her laughing. It was coming from somewhere above me. I looked up, and there she was, standing barefoot on the living-room ceiling.</p>
                <p class="translate">然后我听见了她在笑。声音从我的上方传来。我抬头一看，她在那，光着脚站在了客厅的天花板上。</p>
                <p class="source">I stared open-mouthed. When I found my voice I could only ask, “What the hell . . . are you out of your mind?”</p>
                <p class="translate">我张大了嘴盯着。等我找回了声音后问道，“什么鬼...你疯了吗？”</p>
                <p class="source">She didn't answer, just smiled. Her smile seemed so natural, with her hanging upside-down like that, as if her lips were just stretching on their own by the sheer force of gravity.</p>
                <p class="translate">她没回答，只是笑了笑。她的笑容看起来如此地自然，像她这样倒挂着，犹如地心引力仅仅把她的嘴唇拉开了。</p>
                <p class="source">“Don't worry, I'll get you down,” I said, hurrying to the shelf and grabbing the largest books. I made a tower of encyclopedia volumes and clambered on top of the pile.</p>
                <p class="translate">“别担心，我会把你弄下来，” 我说着，赶紧去书架上拿了些最大的书。我用百科全书做了个塔并爬了上去。</p>
                <p class="source">“This may hurt a little,” I said, trying to keep my balance. She went on smiling. I pulled as hard as I could, but nothing happened. Carefully, I climbed down.</p>
                <p class="translate">“这可能会有点疼，” 我说着，保持着平衡。她继续在笑。我使劲地拉着，但啥也没有发生。小心翼翼地，我爬了下来。</p>
                <p class="source">“Don't worry,” I said. “I'll get the neighbors or something. I'll go next door and call for help.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“别担心，” 我说道。“我会去找邻居什么的。我去下一家找帮手。</p>
                <p class="source">“Fine,” she laughed. “I'm not going anywhere.”</p>
                <p class="translate">“好的，” 她笑着。“我哪也不去。”</p>
                <p class="source">I laughed too. She was so pretty, and so incongruous, hanging upside-down from the ceiling that way. With her long hair dangling downwards, and her breasts molded like two perfect teardrops under her white T-shirt. So pretty. I climbed back up onto the pile of books and kissed her. I felt her tongue on mine. The books tumbled out from under my feet, but I stayed floating in midair, hanging just from her lips.</p>
                <p class="translate">我也笑了。她是如此的美丽，又如此的不协调，像那样倒挂在天花板上。随着她的长发垂下，她的白T恤下的乳房形成了两颗完美的泪滴。我重新爬回了书堆上去亲她。我感觉到了她的舌头在我的舌头上。我脚下的书堆倒了，但我却悬停在了空中，仅仅从她的嘴唇上垂下来。</p>
