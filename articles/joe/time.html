                <p>Tick tock...tick tock...<br />Life is counting down on your internal clock.</p>
                <p>Memories that feel as if they occurred yesterday<br />turn to flashes of moments that seem to fade away.</p>
                <p>People you once knew<br />walk by without a clue.</p>
                <p>The times you once shared<br />exist as if you were never there.</p>
                <p>Years fly...friends die...<br />and you never know when you'll say your last goodbye.</p>
                <p>Oh, how I wish I could turn back time,<br />spend it with loved ones and cherish what once was mine.</p>
                <p>Or to go back even more,<br />being a kid in a candy store.</p>
                <p>How I miss the way I used to feel<br />on Christmas day when Santa was real.</p>
                <p>But back to reality...back to today,<br />family is scarce and memories continue to fade away.</p>
                <p>Tick tock...tick tock...<br />How I wish I could control this clock.</p>
