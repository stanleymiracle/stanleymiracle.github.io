                <p class="source">Anita blinked. She sat up and automatically pushed her hair into place. Cris was standing before the closet. He was reaching up, getting something down.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">He turned toward her and tossed something on the bed. Her heavy metal foil traveling cape.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Anita gazed down at the cape without comprehension. "What do you want?"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Cris stood by the bed, waiting.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">She picked up the cape uncertainly. Cold creepers of fear plucked at her. "You want me to get you out of here," she said softly. "Past the guards and the CP."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Cris said nothing.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"They'll kill you instantly." She got unsteadily to her feet. "You can't run past them. Good God, don't you do anything but run? There must be a better way. Maybe I can appeal to Wisdom. I'm Class A — Director Class. I can go directly to the Full Directorate. I ought to be able to hold them off, keep back the euth indefinitely. The odds are a billion to one against us if we try to break past —"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">She broke off.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"But you don't gamble," she continued slowly. "You don't go by odds. You know what's coming. You've seen the cards already." She studied his face intently. "No, you can't be cold-decked. It wouldn't be possible."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">For a moment she stood deep in thought. Then with a quick, decisive motion, she snatched up the cloak and slipped it around her bare shoulders. She fastened the heavy belt, bent down and got her shoes from under the bed, snatched up her purse, and hurried to the door.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"Come on," she said. She was breathing quickly, cheeks flushed. "Let's go. While there are still a number of exits to choose from. My car is parked outside, in the lot at the side of the building. We can get to my place in an hour. I have a winter home in Argentina. If worse comes to worst we can fly there. It's in the back country, away from the cities. Jungle and swamps. Cut-off from almost everything." Eagerly she started to open the door.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Cris reached out and stopped her. Gently, patiently, he moved in front of her.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">He waited a long time, body rigid. Then he turned the knob and stepped boldly out into the corridor.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">The corridor was empty. No one was in sight. Anita caught a faint glimpse, the back of a guard hurrying off. If they had come out a second earlier —</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Cris started down the corridor. She ran after him. He moved rapidly, effortlessly. The girl had trouble keeping up with him. He seemed to know exactly where to go. Off to the right, down a side hall, a supply passage. Onto an ascent freight-lift. They rose, then abruptly halted.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Cris waited again. Presently he slid the door back and moved out of the lift. Anita followed nervously. She could hear sounds: guns and men, very close.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">They were near an exit. A double line of guards stood directly ahead. Twenty men, a solid wall — and a massive heavy-duty robot gun in the center. The men were alert, faces strained and tense. Watching wide-eyed, guns gripped tight. A Civil Police officer was in charge.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"We'll never get past," Anita gasped. "We wouldn't get ten feet." She pulled back. "They'll —"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Cris took her by the arm and continued calmly forward. Blind terror leaped inside her. She fought wildly to get away, but his fingers were like steel. She couldn't pry them loose. Quietly, irresistibly, the great golden creature drew her along beside him toward the double line of guards.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"There he is!" Guns went up. Men leaped into action. The barrel of the robot cannon swung around. "Get him!"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Anita was paralyzed. She sagged against the powerful body beside her, tugged along helplessly by his inflexible grasp. The lines of guards came nearer, a sheer wall of guns. Anita fought to control her terror. She stumbled, half-fell. Cris supported her effortlessly. She scratched, fought at him, struggled to get loose —</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"Don't shoot!" she screamed.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Guns wavered uncertainly. "Who is she?" The guards were moving around, trying to get a sight on Cris without including her. "Who's he got there?"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">One of them saw the stripe on her sleeve. Red and black. Director Class. Top-level.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"She's Class A." Shocked, the guards retreated. "Miss, get out of the way!"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Anita found her voice. "Don't shoot. He's — in my custody. You understand? I'm taking him out."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">The wall of guards moved back nervously. "No one's supposed to pass. Director Wisdom gave orders —"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"I'm not subject to Wisdom's authority." She managed to edge her voice with a harsh crispness. "Get out of the way. I'm taking him to the Semantics Agency."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">For a moment nothing happened. There was no reaction. Then slowly, uncertainly, one guard stepped aside.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Cris moved. A blur of speed, away from Anita, past the confused guards, through the breach in the line, out the exit, and onto the street. Bursts of energy flashed wildly after him. Shouting guards milled out. Anita was left behind, forgotten. The guards, the heavy-duty gun, were pouring out into the early morning darkness. Sirens wailed. Patrol cars roared into life.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Anita stood dazed, confused, leaning against the wall, trying to get her breath.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">He was gone. He had left her. Good God — what had she done? She shook her head, bewildered, her face buried in her hands. She had been hypnotized. She had lost her will, her common sense. Her reason! The animal, the great golden beast, had tricked her. Taken advantage of her. And now he was gone, escaped into the night.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Miserable, agonized tears trickled through her clenched fingers. She rubbed at them futilely; but they kept on coming.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>
                
                <p class="source">"He's gone," Baines said. "We'll never get him, now. He's probably a million miles from here."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Anita sat huddled in the corner, her face to the wall. A little bent heap, broken and wretched.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">Wisdom paced back and forth. "But where can he go? Where can he hide? Nobody'll hide him! Everybody knows the law about deeves!"</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"He's lived out in the woods most of his life. He'll hunt — that's what he's always done. They wondered what he was up to, off by himself. He was catching game and sleeping under trees." Baines laughed harshly. "And the first woman he meets will be glad to hide him — as she was." He indicated Anita with a jerk of his thumb.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"So all that gold, that mane, that god-like stance, was for something. Not just ornament." Wisdom's thick lips twisted. "He doesn't have just one faculty — he has two. One is new, the newest thing in survival method. The other is old as life." He stopped pacing to glare at the huddled shape in the corner. "Plumage. Bright feathers, combs for the rooster, swans, birds, bright scales for the fish. Gleaming pelts and manes for the animals. An animal isn't necessarily bestial. Lions aren't bestial. Or tigers. Or any of the big cats. They're anything but bestial."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"He'll never have to worry," Baines said. "He'll get by — as long as human women exist to take care of him. And since he can see ahead, into the future, he already knows he's sexually irresistible to human females."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"We'll get him," Wisdom muttered. "I've had the Government declare an emergency. Military and Civil Police will be looking for him. Armies of men — a whole planet of experts, the most advanced machines and equipment. We'll flush him, sooner or later."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"By that time it won't make any difference," Baines said. He put his hand on Anita's shoulder and patted her ironically. "You'll have company, sweetheart. You won't be the only one. You're just the first of a long procession."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"Thanks," Anita grated.</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"The oldest survival method and the newest. Combined to form one perfectly adapted animal. How the hell are we going to stop him? We can put you through a sterilization tank — but we can't pick them all up, all the women he meets along the way. And if we miss one we're finished."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"We'll have to keep trying," Wisdom said. "Round up as many as we can. Before they can spawn." Faint hope glinted in his tired, sagging face. "Maybe his characteristics are recessive. Maybe ours will cancel his out."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>

                <p class="source">"I wouldn't lay any money on that," Baines said. "I think I know already which of the two strains is going to turn up dominant." He grinned wryly. "I mean, I'm making a good guess. It won't be us."</p>
                <p class="translate"></p>
