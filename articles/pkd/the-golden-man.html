                <p class="source">The powers of earth had finally exterminated the last of the horrible tribes of mutant freaks spawned by atomic war. Menace to homo sapien supremacy was about ended — but not quite. For out of the countryside came a great golden, godlike youth whose extraordinary mutant powers, combining the world's oldest and newest methods of survival, promised a new and superior type of mankind…</p>

                <h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>

                <p class="source">"Is it always hot like this?" the salesman demanded. He addressed everybody at the lunch counter and in the shabby booths against the wall. A middle-aged fat man with a good-natured smile, rumpled gray suit, sweat-stained white shirt, a drooping bowtie, and a Panama hat.</p>
                <p class="translate">“总是这么热吗？” 推销员问道。他对在午餐柜台和靠墙的破旧隔间里的所有人讲话。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Only in the summer," the waitress answered.</p>
                <p class="translate">“只有夏天。”女服务员回答道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">None of the others stirred. The teenage boy and girl in one of the booths, eyes fixed intently on each other. Two workmen, sleeves rolled up, arms dark and hairy, eating bean soup and rolls. A lean, weathered farmer. An elderly businessman in a blue-serge suit, vest and pocket watch. A dark rat-faced cab driver drinking coffee. A tired woman who had come in to get off her feet and put down her bundles.</p>
                <p class="translate">其他人都没有动静。其中一个摊位上的男孩和女孩，目光专注地凝视着对方。两个工人挽着袖子，胳膊黑黑的，毛茸茸的，吃着豆汤和面包卷。一个瘦弱、饱经风霜的农民。一位身穿蓝色哔叽西装、背心和怀表的年长商人。一个皮肤黝黑、长着老鼠脸的出租车司机正在喝咖啡。一个疲惫的女人进来，站起来放下包袱。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman got out a package of cigarettes. He glanced curiously around the dingy cafe, lit up, leaned his arms on the counter, and said to the man next to him:</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员拿出一包香烟。他好奇地扫视了一下昏暗的咖啡馆，点了烟，双臂撑在柜台上，对旁边的男人说道：</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What's the name of this town?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“这个镇的名字是什么？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The man grunted. "Walnut Creek."</p>
                <p class="translate">男人哼了一声。 “核桃溪。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman sipped at his coke for a while, cigarette held loosely between plump white fingers. Presently he reached in his coat and brought out a leather wallet. For a long time he leafed thoughtfully through cards and papers, bits of notes, ticket stubs, endless odds and ends, soiled fragments — and finally a photograph.</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员喝了一会儿可乐，白皙的手指松松地夹着香烟。不久，他把手伸进外套，拿出一个皮钱包。很长一段时间，他若有所思地翻找于卡片和纸张、零碎的笔记、票根、无穷无尽的零碎物品、脏兮兮的碎片之中——最后翻出一张照片。</p>
                
                <p class="source">He grinned at the photograph, and then began to chuckle, a low moist rasp. "Look at this," he said to the man beside him.</p>
                <p class="translate">他对着照片笑了笑，然后开始咯咯地笑，声音低沉、湿润。“看看这个，”他对旁边的男人说道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The man went on reading his newspaper.</p>
                <p class="translate">那人继续看报纸。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Hey, look at this." The salesman nudged him with his elbow and pushed the photograph at him. "How's that strike you?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“嘿，看看这个。”推销员用手肘碰了碰他，然后把照片推给了他。“你觉得怎么样？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Annoyed, the man glanced briefly at the the photograph. It showed a nude woman, from the waist up. Perhaps thirty-five years old. Face turned away. Body white and flabby. With eight breasts.</p>
                <p class="translate">男人恼怒地瞥了一眼照片。它显示了一个从腰部以上裸体的女人。也许三十五岁。脸转过去。身体白色且松弛。有八个乳房。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Ever seen anything like that?" the salesman chuckled, his little red eyes dancing. His face broke into lewd smiles and again he nudged the man.</p>
                <p class="translate">“见过像这样的吗？”推销员咯咯笑起来，红红的小眼睛在跳动。他的脸上绽放出淫荡的笑容，再次用肘碰了碰那个男人。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I've seen that before." Disgusted, the man resumed reading his newspaper.</p>
                <p class="translate">“我以前见过。”男人感到厌恶，又继续看报纸。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman noticed the lean old farmer was looking at the picture. He passed it genially over to him. "How's that strike you, pop? Pretty good stuff, eh?"</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员注意到那个精瘦的老农正在看照片。他和蔼地把它递给了他。 “你觉得怎么样，老哥？相当不错的东西，嗯？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The farmer examined the picture solemnly. He turned it over, studied the creased back, took a second look at the front, then tossed it to the salesman. It slid from the counter, turned over a couple of times, and fell to the floor face up.</p>
                <p class="translate">农夫严肃地审视着这张照片。他把它翻过来，研究了背面的折痕，又看了一眼正面，然后把它扔给了推销员。照片从柜台上滑下来，翻转了几次，然后面朝上掉到了地板上。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman picked it up and brushed it off. Carefully, almost tenderly, he restored it to his wallet. The waitress' eyes flickered as she caught a glimpse of it.</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员把它捡起来，然后擦了擦。他小心翼翼地、近乎温柔地把它放回钱包里。女服务员看到这一幕，眼神闪烁。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Damn nice," the salesman observed, with a wink. "Wouldn't you say so?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“该死的好，”推销员眨了眨眼睛观察道。“你不觉得吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The waitress shrugged indifferently. "I don't know. I saw a lot of them around Denver. A whole colony."</p>
                <p class="translate">女服务员无所谓地耸耸肩。“我不知道。我在丹佛周围看到了很多它们。一整个殖民地那么多。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"That's where this was taken. Denver DCA Camp."</p>
                <p class="translate">“那里就是这张照片的拍摄地。丹佛 DCA 营。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Any still alive?" the farmer asked.</p>
                <p class="translate">“还有活着的吗？” 农夫问。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman laughed harshly. "You kidding?" He made a short, sharp swipe with his hand. "Not any more."</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员使劲地笑道。 “你开玩笑吧？” 他用手轻轻一挥。 “一个也没有。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">They were all listening. Even the high school kids in the booth had stopped holding hands and were sitting up straight, eyes wide with fascination.</p>
                <p class="translate">他们都在听。 就连摊位上的高中生也不再牵着手，坐直了身子，睁大了眼睛，满脸着迷。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Saw a funny kind down near San Diego," the farmer said. "Last year, some time. Had wings like a bat. Skin, not feathers. Skin and bone wings."</p>
                <p class="translate">“在圣地亚哥附近看到了一种有趣的，”农民说。 “去年的某个时候。有像蝙蝠一样的翅膀。只有皮肤，没有羽毛。皮肤和骨翅膀。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The rat-eyed taxi driver chimed in. "That's nothing. There was a two-headed one in Detroit. I saw it on exhibit."</p>
                <p class="translate">老鼠眼的出租车司机插话道：“这没什么。底特律有一个双头的。我在展览中看到过它。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Was it alive?" the waitress asked.</p>
                <p class="translate">“它还活着吗？” 女服务员问道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"No. They'd already euthed it."</p>
                <p class="translate">“不。他们已经把它安乐死了。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"In sociology," the high school boy spoke up, "we saw tapes of a whole lot of them. The winged kind from down south, the big-headed one they found in Germany, an awful-looking one with sort of cones, like an insect. And —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“在社会学的课上，”高中生开口说道,“我们看到了很多关于它们的录像带。来自南方的带翅膀的，他们在德国发现的大头的，一种长相可怕的，带有锥体，像昆虫一样。而且 ——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"The worst of all," the elderly businessman stated, "are those English ones. That hid out in the coal mines. The ones they didn't find until last year." He shook his head.</p>
                <p class="translate">“最糟糕的是，”年长的商人表示，“是那些来自英国的。藏在煤矿里。直到去年他们才找到的。”他摇了摇头。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Forty years, down there in the mines, breeding and developing. Almost a hundred of them. Survivors from a group that went underground during the War."</p>
                <p class="translate">“四十年来，在矿井里，繁殖和发育。几乎有一百个。战争期间一群进入地下的幸存者。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"They just found a new kind in Sweden," the waitress said. "I was reading about it. Controls minds at a distance, they said. Only a couple of them. The DCA got there plenty fast."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他们刚刚在瑞典发现了一个新品种，”女服务员说。 “我读到过相关报道。他们说，可以远距离控制思想，只有几个。DCA 很快就到达了那里。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"That's a variation of the New Zealand type," one of the workmen said. "It read minds."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这是新西兰类型的变种，”一名工人说。 “它会读心术。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Reading and controlling are two different things," the businessman said. "When I hear something like that I'm plenty glad there's the DCA."</p>
                <p class="translate">“读心术和思想控制是两件不同的事情，”这位商人说。 “当我听到这样的事情时，我很高兴有 DCA。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"There was a type they found right after the War," the farmer said. "In Siberia. Had the ability to control objects. Psychokinetic ability. The Soviet DCA got it right away. Nobody remembers that any more."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他们在战后就发现了一种类型，”农民说。 “在西伯利亚。有控制物体的能力。念动力能力。苏联DCA马上就得到了。再也没有人记得了。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I remember that," the businessman said. "I was just a kid, then. I remember because that was the first deeve I ever heard of. My father called me into the living room and told me and my brothers and sisters. We were still building the house. That was in the days when the DCA inspected everyone and stamped their arms." He held up his thin, gnarled wrist. "I was stamped there, sixty years ago."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我记得，”商人说。 “那时我还只是个孩子。我记得因为那是我听说过的第一个deeve（变种人称呼）。我父亲把我叫进客厅，告诉我和我的兄弟姐妹。我们还在盖房子。那是在 那些日子里，DCA 检查了每个人，并在他们的手臂上盖了章。” 他举起那只瘦弱、多节的手腕。 “六十年前，我就在那儿留下了印记。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Now they just have the birth inspection," the waitress said. She shivered. "There was one in San Francisco this month. First in over a year. They thought it was over, around here."</p>
                <p class="translate">“现在他们只做产检了，”女服务员说。 她颤抖着。 “这个月在旧金山发生了一次。这是一年多以来的第一次。他们还以为这附近的情况已经结束了。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"It's been dwindling," the taxi driver said. "Frisco wasn't too bad hit. Not like some. Not like Detroit."</p>
                <p class="translate">“数量正在减少，”出租车司机说。 “弗里斯科（丹佛附近的城市）的打击并不算太严重。不像某些地方。不像底特律。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"They still get ten or fifteen a year in Detroit," the high school boy said. "All around there. Lots of pools still left. People go into them, in spite of the robot signs."</p>
                <p class="translate">“在底特律，他们每年仍然有十到十五个，”高中生说。 “周围都有。还有很多池子剩下。尽管有机器人标志，人们还是进去了。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What kind was this one?" the salesman asked. "The one they found in San Francisco."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这是什么类型的？” 推销员问道。 “他们在旧金山发现的那个。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The waitress gestured. "Common type. The kind with no toes. Bent-over. Big eyes."</p>
                <p class="translate">女服务员做了个手势。 “普通型，没有脚趾的那种，弯着腰，眼睛很大。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"The nocturnal type," the salesman said.</p>
                <p class="translate">“夜行型，”推销员说。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"The mother had hid it. They say it was three years old. She got the doctor to forge the DCA chit. Old friend of the family."</p>
                <p class="translate">“母亲把它藏起来了。他们说它已经三岁了。她让医生伪造了 DCA 凭证。通过家里的老朋友。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman had finished his coke. He sat playing idly with his cigarettes, listening to the hum of talk he had set into motion. The high school boy was leaning excitedly toward the girl across from him, impressing her with his fund of knowledge. The lean farmer and the businessman were huddled together, remembering the old days, the last years of the War, before the first Ten-Year Reconstruction Plan. The taxi driver and the two workmen were swapping yarns about their own experiences.</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员已经喝完了他的可乐。 他无所事事地坐着玩着香烟，听着他发起的谈话的嗡嗡声。 高中男生兴奋地靠向对面的女孩，他丰富的知识给她留下了深刻的印象。 瘦弱的农民和商人挤在一起，回忆着过去的日子，回忆着战争的最后几年，也就是第一个十年重建计划之前的日子。 出租车司机和两名工人正在交换各自的经历。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman caught the waitress's attention. "I guess," he said thoughtfully, "that one in Frisco caused quite a stir. Something like that happening so close."</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员引起了女服务员的注意。 “我想，”他若有所思地说，“弗里斯科的那件事引起了不小的轰动。类似的事情就发生在这么近的地方。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Yeah," the waitress murmured.</p>
                <p class="translate">“是啊，”女服务员低声说道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"This side of the Bay wasn't really hit," the salesman continued. "You never get any of them over here."</p>
                <p class="translate">“海湾的这一边并没有受到真正的打击，”推销员继续说道。 “你永远不会在这里见到他们。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"No." The waitress moved abruptly. "None in this area. Ever." She scooped up dirty dishes from the counter and headed toward the back.</p>
                <p class="translate">“不。” 女服务员突然动了动。 “这个地区没有。从来没有。” 她从柜台上舀起脏盘子，朝后面走去。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Never?" the salesman asked, surprised. "You've never had any deeves on this side of the Bay?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“从来没有？” 推销员惊讶地问道。 “海湾这边从来没有过任何deeve吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"No. None." She disappeared into the back, where the fry cook stood by his burners, white apron and tattooed wrists. Her voice was a little too loud, a little too harsh and strained. It made the farmer pause suddenly and glance up.</p>
                <p class="translate">“没有。一个也没有。” 她到了后面去了，油炸厨师站在他的炉子旁，穿着白色围裙，手腕上有纹身。 她的声音有点太大了，有点太刺耳和紧张。 这让农夫突然停了下来，抬起头来。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Silence dropped like a curtain. All sound cut off instantly. They were all gazing down at their food, suddenly tense and ominous.</p>
                <p class="translate">寂静如幕布般落下。 所有声音瞬间断绝。 他们都低头看着自己的食物，突然变得紧张而不祥。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"None around here," the taxi driver said, loudly and clearly, to no one in particular. "None ever."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这附近一个也没有。”出租车司机大声而清晰地说道，没有针对任何人。 “从来没有。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Sure," the salesman agreed genially. "I was only —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“当然。”推销员和蔼地答应道。 “我只是——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Make sure you get that straight," one of the workmen said.</p>
                <p class="translate">“你一定要弄清楚，”其中一名工人说。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman blinked. "Sure, buddy. Sure." He fumbled nervously in his pocket. A quarter and a dime jangled to the floor and he hurriedly scooped them up. "No offense."</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员眨了眨眼睛。 “当然，伙计。当然。” 他紧张地在口袋里摸索。 一枚25美分和一毛钱叮当作响地掉在地上，他赶紧把它们捡起来。 “没有冒犯的意思。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">For a moment there was silence. Then the high school boy spoke up, aware for the first time that nobody was saying anything. "I heard something," he began eagerly, voice full of importance. "Somebody said they saw something up by the Johnson farm that looked like it was one of those —"</p>
                <p class="translate">一时间寂静无声。 然后高中男生开口了，他第一次意识到没有人在说话。 “我听到了一些声音，”他急切地说道，声音充满了重要性。 “有人说他们在Johnson农场附近看到了一些东西，看起来就像是其中之一——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Shut up," the businessman said, without turning his head.</p>
                <p class="translate">“闭嘴，”商人头也不回地说道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Scarlet-faced, the boy sagged in his seat. His voice wavered and broke off. He peered hastily down at his hands and swallowed unhappily.</p>
                <p class="translate">男孩脸色猩红，瘫坐在座位上。 他的声音颤抖着，然后就断了。 他急忙低头看了看自己的双手，不高兴地咽了口口水。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman paid the waitress for his coke. "What's the quickest road to Frisco?" he began. But the waitress had already turned her back.</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员付给女服务员买可乐的钱。 “去弗里斯科最快的路是什么？” 他开始说。 但女服务员已经转过身去。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The people at the counter were immersed in their food. None of them looked up. They ate in frozen silence. Hostile, unfriendly faces, intent on their food.</p>
                <p class="translate">柜台前的人们都沉浸在食物中。 他们都没有抬头。 他们在冰冷的沉默中吃着饭。 充满敌意、不友好的面孔，专注于他们的食物。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman picked up his bulging briefcase, pushed open the screen door, and stepped out into the blazing sunlight. He moved toward his battered 1978 Buick, parked a few meters up. A blue-shirted traffic cop was standing in the shade of an awning, talking languidly to a young woman in a yellow silk dress that clung moistly to her slim body.</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员拎起鼓鼓囊囊的公文包，推开门帘，走进了炽热的阳光下。 他朝停在几米外的那辆破旧的 1978 年别克车走去。 一名身穿蓝衬衫的交警站在遮阳篷的阴影下，正与一位穿着黄色丝质连衣裙的年轻女子慵懒地交谈着，连衣裙湿漉漉地贴在她的苗条身材上。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The salesman paused a moment before he got into his car. He waved his hand and hailed the policeman. "Say, you know this town pretty good?"</p>
                <p class="translate">推销员在上车前停顿了一下。 他挥挥手，向警察打招呼。 “话说，你对这个小镇很了解吧？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The policeman eyed the salesman's rumpled gray suit, bowtie, his sweat-stained shirt. The out-of-state license. "What do you want?"</p>
                <p class="translate">警察看着推销员皱巴巴的灰色西装、领结和汗渍斑斑的衬衫。 州外执照（意思是外州人）。 “你想干什么？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I'm looking for the Johnson farm," the salesman said. "Here to see him about some litigation." He moved toward the policeman, a small white card between his fingers.</p>
                <p class="translate">“我正在寻找Johnson的农场，”推销员说。 “来见他，是为了一些诉讼。” 他走向警察，手指间夹着一张白色的小卡片。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I'm his attorney — from the New York Guild. Can you tell me how to get out there? I haven't been through here in a couple of years."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我是他的律师——来自纽约行会。你能告诉我怎么出去吗？我已经好几年没来过这里了。”</p>

                <h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>

                <p class="source">Nat Johnson gazed up at the noonday sun and saw that it was good. He sat sprawled out on the bottom step of the porch, a pipe between his yellowed teeth, a lithe, wiry man in red-checkered shirt and canvas jeans, powerful hands, iron-gray hair that was still thick despite sixty-five years of active life.</p>
                <p class="translate">Nat Johnson抬头凝视着正午的阳光，发现天气很好。 他四肢摊开地坐在门廊的最下面一级台阶上，发黄的牙齿间叼着一根烟斗，身着红格子衬衫和帆布牛仔裤，身体轻盈，身材魁梧，双手有力，铁灰色的头发依然浓密，尽管已经过了六十五年的积极生活了。</p>
                
                <p class="source">He was watching the children play. Jean rushed laughing in front of him, bosom heaving under her sweatshirt, black hair streaming behind her. She was sixteen, bright-eyed, legs strong and straight, slim young body bent slightly forward with the weight of the two horseshoes. After her scampered Dave, fourteen, white teeth and black hair, a handsome boy, a son to be proud of. Dave caught up with his sister, passed her, and reached the far peg. He stood waiting, legs apart, hands on his hips, his two horseshoes gripped easily. Gasping, Jean hurried toward him.</p>
                <p class="translate">他正在看孩子们玩耍。 Jean冲到他面前笑着，运动衫下的胸部起伏着，黑色的头发在她身后飘扬。 她十六岁，眼睛明亮，双腿有力而笔直，苗条年轻的身体因两只马蹄铁的重量而微微前倾。 在她兴奋地跑过Dave之后，十四岁，洁白的牙齿和黑发，一个英俊的男孩，一个值得骄傲的儿子。 Dave追上了他的姐姐，超过了她，到达了远处的木桩处。 他站在那里等待，双腿分立，双手放在腰间，轻松地握住了两只马蹄铁。 Jean喘着粗气，急忙朝他走去。（<span class="text-to-img" data-path="../imgs/h-game.png">扔马蹄铁</span>）</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Go ahead!" Dave shouted. "You shoot first. I'm waiting for you."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你先吧！” Dave喊道。 “你先扔，我等你。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"So you can knock them away?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“这样你能把他们砸走吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"So I can knock them closer."/p>
                <p class="translate">“这样我就可以把他们砸得更近。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Jean tossed down one horseshoe and gripped the other with both hands, eyes on the distant peg. Her lithe body bent, one leg slid back, her spine arched. She took careful aim, closed one eye, and then expertly tossed the shoe. With a clang the shoe struck the distant peg, circled briefly around it, then bounced off again and rolled to one side. A cloud of dust rolled up.</p>
                <p class="translate">Jean扔下一只马蹄铁，用双手抓住另一只，眼睛盯着远处的钉子。 她柔软的身体弯曲，一条腿向后滑，脊椎弓起。 她仔细瞄准，闭上一只眼睛，然后熟练地把它扔了过去。 叮当一声，马蹄铁撞到了远处的木桩上，短暂地绕着它转了一圈，然后又弹开了，滚到了一边。 一团尘土卷起。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Not bad," Nat Johnson admitted, from his step. "Too hard, though. Take it easy." His chest swelled with pride as the girl's glistening body took aim and again threw. Two powerful, handsome children, almost ripe, on the verge of adulthood. Playing together in the hot sun.</p>
                <p class="translate">“不错，”Nat Johnson站着承认道。 “不过太难了。放轻松。” 当女孩闪闪发光的身体瞄准并再次投掷时，他的胸膛因自豪而膨胀。 两个强大、英俊的孩子，已经快成熟了，即将成年。 在烈日下一起玩耍。</p>
                
                <p class="source">And there was Cris.</p>
                <p class="translate">然后还有Cris。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Cris stood by the porch, arms folded. He wasn't playing. He was watching. He had stood there since Dave and Jean had begun playing, the same half-intent, half-remote expression on his finely-cut face. As if he were seeing past them, beyond the two of them. Beyond the field, the barn, the creek bed, the rows of cedars.</p>
                <p class="translate">Cris抱着双臂站在门廊旁。 他没有在玩。 他在看着。 自从Dave和Jean开始玩以来，他就站在那里，他那张精致的脸上带着同样的半专注、半冷漠的表情。 仿佛他的目光超越了他们，超越了他们两个人。 在田野，谷仓、河床和一排排雪松树之外。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Come on, Cris!" Jean called, as she and Dave moved across the field to collect their horseshoes. "Don't you want to play?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“来吧，Cris！” 当Jean和Dave穿过田野去取马蹄铁时，她喊道。 “你不想玩吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">No, Cris didn't want to play. He never played. He was off in a world of his own, a world into which none of them could come. He never joined in anything, games or chores or family activities. He was by himself always. Remote, detached, aloof. Seeing past everyone and everything — that is, until all at once something clicked and he momentarily rephased, reentered their world briefly.</p>
                <p class="translate">不，Cris不想玩。 他从来没有玩过。 他进入了一个属于他自己的世界，一个他们谁也无法进入的世界。 他从不参加任何事情，游戏、家务或家庭活动。 他总是一个人。 疏远、脱离、冷漠。 看透了所有人和一切——也就是说，直到突然有什么东西响起，他暂时重新调整相位，短暂地重新进入他们的世界。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Nat Johnson reached out and knocked his pipe against the step. He refilled it from his leather tobacco pouch, his eyes on his eldest son. Cris was now moving into life. Heading out onto the field. He walked slowly, arms folded calmly, as if he had, for the moment, descended from his own world into theirs. Jean didn't see him; she had turned her back and was getting ready to pitch.</p>
                <p class="translate">Nat Johnson伸出手来，把他的烟斗撞到了台阶上。 他从皮革烟袋里重新装满了烟，眼睛盯着他的大儿子。 Cris现在已经开始融入他们。 出发前往农田。 他缓缓地走着，双臂平静地交叉着，仿佛此刻他已经从自己的世界跌入了他们的世界。 Jean没有看见他；她转身准备投铁。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Hey," Dave said, startled. "Here's Cris."</p>
                <p class="translate">“嘿，”Dave吃惊地说。 “这是Cris。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Cris reached his sister, stopped, and held out his hand. A great dignified figure, calm and impassive. Uncertainly, Jean gave him one of the horseshoes. "You want this? You want to play?"</p>
                <p class="translate">Cris走到他妹妹身边，停了下来，伸出了手。 身材高大威严，冷静而冷漠。 Jean不确定地给了他一只马蹄铁。 “你想要这个吗？你想玩吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Cris said nothing. He bent slightly, a supple arc of his incredibly graceful body, then moved his arm in a blur of speed. The shoe sailed, struck the far peg, and dizzily spun around it. Ringer.</p>
                <p class="translate">Cris什么也没说。 他微微弯腰，优美的身体呈现出柔软的弧度，然后以模糊的速度移动手臂。 马蹄铁飞了起来，撞到了远处的钉子，然后晕眩般地绕着它旋转。 挂上了（像bingo）。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The corners of Dave's mouth turned down. "What a lousy darn thing."</p>
                <p class="translate">Dave的嘴角弯了下来。 “多么糟糕的事情啊。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Cris," Jean reproved. "You don't play fair."</p>
                <p class="translate">“Cris，”Jean责备道。 “你耍赖。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">No, Cris didn't play fair. He had watched half an hour — then come out and thrown once. One perfect toss, one dead ringer.</p>
                <p class="translate">不，Cris耍赖了。 他看了半个小时——然后出来扔了一次。 一次完美的投掷，一次完美的挂上了。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"He never makes a mistake," Dave complained.</p>
                <p class="translate">“他从不犯错误，”Dave抱怨道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Cris stood, face blank. A golden statue in the mid-day sun. Golden hair, skin, a light down of gold fuzz on his bare arms and legs —</p>
                <p class="translate">Cris站着，面无表情。 正午阳光下的金色雕像。 金色的头发，皮肤，裸露的手臂和腿上有一缕金色的绒毛 ——</p>
                
                <p class="source">Abruptly he stiffened. Nat sat up, startled. "What is it?" he barked.</p>
                <p class="translate">突然他全身僵硬。 Nat猛地坐了起来。 “怎么了？” 他咆哮道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Cris turned in a quick circle, magnificent body alert. "Cris!" Jean demanded. "What —"</p>
                <p class="translate">Cris快速转了一圈，身体十分警觉。 “Cris！” Jean问道。 “什么 -”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Cris shot forward. Like a released energy beam he bounded across the field, over the fence, into the barn and out the other side. His flying figure seemed to skim over the dry grass as he descended into the barren creek bed, between the cedars. A momentary flash of gold — and he was gone. Vanished. There was no sound. No motion. He had utterly melted into the scenery.</p>
                <p class="translate">Cris向前冲去。 他就像一道释放的能量束，跳跃着穿过田野，越过栅栏，进入谷仓，从另一边出去。 当他下降到雪松之间贫瘠的河床上时，他飞翔的身影似乎掠过干草。 金光一闪 —— 他就不见了。 消失了。 没有声音。 没有动静。 他已经完全融入了风景之中。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What was it this time?" Jean asked wearily. She came over to her father and threw herself down in the shade. Sweat glowed on her smooth neck and upper lip; her sweat shirt was streaked and damp. "What did he see?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“这次是什么？” Jean疲倦地问道。 她走到父亲身边，倒在阴凉处。 她光滑的脖子和上唇上都冒着汗水。 她的运动衫上有条纹，而且湿漉漉的。 “他看到了什么？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"He was after something," Dave stated, coming up.</p>
                <p class="translate">“他在追什么，”Dave走上前来说道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Nat grunted. "Maybe. There's no telling."</p>
                <p class="translate">Nat咕哝道。 “也许吧。目前还不清楚。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I guess I better tell Mom not to set a place for him," Jean said. "He probably won't be back."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我想我最好告诉妈妈不要给他安排地方，”Jean说。 “他可能不会回来了。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Anger and futility descended over Nat Johnson. No, he wouldn't be back. Not for dinner and probably not the next day — or the one after that. He'd be gone God only knew how long. Or where. Or why. Off by himself, alone some place. "If I thought there was any use," Nat began, "I'd send you two after him. But there's no —"</p>
                <p class="translate">愤怒和徒劳降临到Nat Johnson身上。 不，他不会回来。 不为了晚餐，也可能不是第二天——或者之后的一天。 天知道他会离开多久。 或者在哪里。 或者为什么。 独自一人，独自去某个地方。 “如果我认为有什么用处，”Nat开始说道，“我会派你们两个人去追他。但是没有——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">He broke off. A car was coming up the dirt road toward the farmhouse. A dusty, battered old Buick. Behind the wheel sat a plump red-faced man in a gray suit, who waved cheerfully at them as the car sputtered to a stop and the motor died into silence.</p>
                <p class="translate">他停了下来。 一辆汽车沿着土路驶向农舍。 一辆布满灰尘、破旧不堪的老别克车。 方向盘后面坐着一个身穿灰色西装、红脸的胖男人，当汽车停了下来、发动机陷入一片寂静时，他高兴地向他们挥手。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Afternoon," the man nodded, as he climbed out the car. He tipped his hat pleasantly. He was middle-aged, genial-looking, perspiring freely as he crossed the dry ground toward the porch. "Maybe you folks can help me."</p>
                <p class="translate">“下午好。”男人下车后，点了点头。 他愉快地倾斜了帽子。 他是个中年人，看上去和蔼可亲，穿过干燥的地面朝门廊走去，大汗淋漓。 “也许你们可以帮助我。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What do you want?" Nat Johnson demanded hoarsely. He was frightened. He watched the creek bed out of the corner of his eye, praying silently. God, if only he stayed away. Jean was breathing quickly, sharp little gasps. She was terrified. Dave's face was expressionless, but all color had drained from it. "Who are you?" Nat demanded.</p>
                <p class="translate">“你想怎么样？” Nat Johnson嘶哑地问道。 他很害怕。 他用眼角的余光看着河床，默默地祈祷。 天哪，要是他没过来就好了。 Jean呼吸急促，喘息声急促。 她很害怕。 Dave的脸上毫无表情，但所有的血色都消失了。 “你是谁？” Nat问道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Name's Baines. George Baines." The man held out his hand but Johnson ignored it. "Maybe you've heard of me. I own the Pacifica Development Corporation. We built all those little bomb-proof houses just outside town. Those little round ones you see as you come up the main highway from Lafayette."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我叫Baines。George Baines。” 那人伸出了手，但Johnson没有理睬。 “也许你听说过我。我拥有太平洋开发公司。我们在城外建造了所有那些防弹小房子。当你从拉法叶沿着主干道走上来时，你会看到那些圆形的小房子。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What do you want?" Johnson held his hands steady with an effort. He'd never heard of the man, although he'd noticed the housing tract. It couldn't be missed — a great ant-heap of ugly pill-boxes straddling the highway. Baines looked like the kind of man who'd own them. But what did he want here?</p>
                <p class="translate">“你想怎么样？” Johnson努力稳住双手。 尽管他注意到了那片住宅区，但他从未听说过这个人。 错过不了的——一大堆丑陋的碉堡横跨在高速公路上。 Baines看上去就是那种拥有它们的人。 但他来这里到底想要什么？</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I've bought some land up this way," Baines was explaining. He rattled a sheaf of crisp papers. "This is the deed, but I'll be damned if I can find it." He grinned good-naturedly. "I know it's around this way, someplace, this side of the State road. According to the clerk at the County Recorder's Office, a mile or so this side of that hill over there. But I'm no damn good at reading maps."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我在这个方向上买了一些土地，”Baines解释道。 他把一叠脆纸弄得格格作响。 “这就是契约，但如果不能找到它，我就太该死了。” 他善意地笑了笑。 “我知道它就在这条路附近的某个地方，州际道的这边。据县记录办公室的职员说，就在那边山的这边一英里左右。但我不擅长阅读地图。 ”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"It isn't around here," Dave broke in. "There's only farms around here. Nothing for sale."</p>
                <p class="translate">“它不在这附近，”Dave插话道，“这附近只有农场。没有被卖的地。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"This is a farm, son," Baines said genially. "I bought it for myself and my missus. So we could settle down." He wrinkled his pug nose. "Don't get the wrong idea — I'm not putting up any tracts around here. This is strictly for myself. An old farmhouse, twenty acres, a pump and a few oak trees —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“这是一个农场，孩子，”Baines和蔼地说。 “我给自己和我太太买的。这样我们就可以安定下来了。” 他皱起了哈巴狗鼻子。 “别误会——我不会在这附近张贴任何小牌子。这完全是为了我自己。一栋旧农舍，二十英亩，一台水泵和几棵橡树——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Let me see the deed." Johnson grabbed the sheaf of papers, and while Baines blinked in astonishment, he leafed rapidly through them. His face hardened and he handed them back. "What are you up to? This deed is for a parcel fifty miles from here."</p>
                <p class="translate">“让我看看契约。” Johnson抓起那叠文件，Baines惊讶地眨着眼睛，他快速地翻阅着它们。 他的脸色变得严肃起来，然后把它们递了回来。 “你在做什么？这份契约是关于距这里五十英里的一个集装箱的。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Fifty miles!" Baines was dumbfounded. "No kidding? But the clerk told me —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“五十里！” Baines傻眼了。 “别开玩笑了？但是店员告诉我——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Johnson was on his feet. He towered over the fat man. He was in top-notch physical shape — and he was plenty damn suspicious. "Clerk, hell. You get back into your car and drive out of here. I don't know what you're after, or what you're here for, but I want you off my land."</p>
                <p class="translate">Johnson站了起来。 他比胖子还要高大。 他的体格是一流的——而且他非常多疑。 “职员，见鬼。你赶紧回到你的车里，开车离开这里。我不知道你在找什么，也不知道你来这里的目的是什么，但我希望你离开我的土地。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">In Johnson's massive fist something sparkled. A metal tube that gleamed ominously in the mid-day sunlight. Baines saw it — and gulped. "No offense, mister." He backed nervously away. "You folks sure are touchy. Take it easy, will you?"</p>
                <p class="translate">Johnson巨大的拳头里有东西在闪闪发光。 一根金属管在正午的阳光下闪烁着不祥的光芒。 Baines看到了——然后咽了口口水。 “无意冒犯，先生。” 他紧张地后退了一步。 “你们真是太敏感了。别紧张，好吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Johnson said nothing. He gripped the lash-tube tighter and waited for the fat man to leave.</p>
                <p class="translate">Johnson什么也没说。 他把抽管握得更紧，等待胖子的离开。</p>
                
                <p class="source">But Baines lingered. "Look, buddy. I've been driving around this furnace five hours, looking for my damn place. Any objection to my using your facilities?"</p>
                <p class="translate">但Baines却犹豫不决。 “听着，伙计。我已经在这个熔炉周围开车五个小时了，寻找我那该死的地方。有人反对我使用你的厕所吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Johnson eyed him with suspicion. Gradually the suspicion turned to disgust. He shrugged. "Dave, show him where the bathroom is."</p>
                <p class="translate">Johnson怀疑地看着他。 渐渐地，怀疑变成了厌恶。 他耸耸肩。 “Dave，带他看看厕所在哪里。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Thanks." Baines grinned thankfully. "And if it wouldn't be too much trouble, maybe a glass of water. I'd be glad to pay you for it." He chuckled knowingly. "Never let the city people get away with anything, eh?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“谢谢。” Baines感激地笑了。 “如果不太麻烦的话，也许要一杯水。我很乐意付钱给你。” 他会意地笑了笑。 “永远不要让城里人得逞，嗯？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Christ." Johnson turned away in revulsion as the fat man lumbered after his son, into the house.</p>
                <p class="translate">“天哪。” 当胖子拖着笨重的脚步跟着儿子走进屋子时，Johnson厌恶地转过身去。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Dad," Jean whispered. As soon as Baines was inside she hurried up onto the porch, eyes wide with fear. "Dad, do you think he —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“爸，”Jean低声叫道。 Baines一进门，她就急忙跑到门廊上，眼睛里充满了恐惧。 “爸，你认为他——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Johnson put his arm around her. "Just hold on tight. He'll be gone, soon."</p>
                <p class="translate">Johnson用手臂搂住她。 “坚持住。他很快就会离开的。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The girl's dark eyes flashed with mute terror. "Every time the man from the water company, or the tax collector, some tramp, children, anybody come around, I get a terrible stab of pain — here." She clutched at her heart, hand against her breasts. "It's been that way thirteen years. How much longer can we keep it going? How long?"</p>
                <p class="translate">女孩的黑眸里闪烁着无言的恐惧。 “每次自来水公司的人、税务员、流浪汉、孩子、任何人过来时，我都会感到一阵剧痛——在这里。” 她捂着自己的心，手放在胸前。 “就这样十三年了。我们还能坚持多久呢？多久呢？”</p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>  
                
                <h2 id="part-3">Part 3</h2>

                <p class="source">The man named Baines emerged gratefully from the bathroom. Dave Johnson stood silently by the door, body rigid, youthful face stony.</p>
                <p class="translate">名叫Baines的男人满怀感激地从厕所里出来。 Dave Johnson静静地站在门口，身体僵硬，年轻的脸冷酷无情。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Thanks, son," Baines sighed. "Now where can I get a glass of cold water?" He smacked his thick lips in anticipation. "After you've been driving around the sticks looking for a dump some red-hot real estate agent stuck you with —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“谢谢，孩子，”Baines叹了口气。 “现在哪里可以喝杯凉水呢？” 他抿了抿厚嘴唇，满怀期待。 “当你开车兜风寻找被某个炙手可热的房地产经纪人把你困住了的那个垃圾场后——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Dave headed into the kitchen. "Mom, this man wants a drink of water. Dad said he could have it."</p>
                <p class="translate">Dave走进厨房。 “妈，这个人想要喝水，爸说他可以喝。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Dave had turned his back. Baines caught a brief glimpse of the mother, gray-haired, small, moving toward the sink with a glass, face withered and drawn, without expression.</p>
                <p class="translate">Dave转过身去。 Baines瞥见了那位母亲，她头发灰白，身材娇小，拿着玻璃杯朝水槽走去，脸色枯萎、憔悴，没有任何表情。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Then Baines hurried from the room down a hall. He passed through a bedroom, pulled a door open, found himself facing a closet. He turned and raced back, through the living room, into a dining room, then another bedroom. In a brief instant he had gone through the whole house.</p>
                <p class="translate">然后Baines匆匆离开房间，穿过走廊。 他穿过一间卧室，拉开门，发现自己面对着一个壁橱。 他转身跑回来，穿过客厅，走进餐厅，然后又跑到另一间卧室。 转眼间他就走遍了整间屋子。</p>
                
                <p class="source">He peered out a window. The back yard. Remains of a rusting truck. Entrance of an underground bomb shelter. Tin cans. Chickens scratching around. A dog, asleep under a shed. A couple of old auto tires.</p>
                <p class="translate">他向窗外望去。 后院。 一辆生锈的卡车的残骸。 地下防空洞的入口。 锡罐。 鸡们到处乱抓。 一只狗在棚子下睡觉。 几个旧汽车轮胎。</p>
                
                <p class="source">He found a door leading out. Soundlessly, he tore the door open and stepped outside. No one was in sight. There was the barn, a leaning, ancient wood structure. Cedar trees beyond, a creek of some kind. What had once been an outhouse.</p>
                <p class="translate">他找到了一扇通向外面的门。 他无声无息地打开门，走了出去。 看不见任何人。 那里有一个谷仓，一座倾斜的古老木结构建筑。 远处有雪松树，有一条小溪之类的东西。 这里曾经是一个外屋。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines moved cautiously around the side of the house. He had perhaps thirty seconds. He had left the door of the bathroom closed; the boy would think he had gone back in there. Baines looked into the house through a window. A large closet, filled with old clothing, boxes and bundles of magazines.</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines小心翼翼地绕着房子的一侧走动。 他大概还有三十秒的时间。 他留着厕所的门紧闭。 男孩会以为他又回到了那里。 Baines透过窗户往房子里看。 一个大衣柜，里面装满了旧衣服、盒子和成捆的杂志。</p>
                
                <p class="source">He turned and started back. He reached the corner of the house and started around it.</p>
                <p class="translate">他转身开始往回走。 他走到房子的一角，开始绕过它。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Nat Johnson's gaunt shape loomed up and blocked his way. "All right, Baines. You asked for it."</p>
                <p class="translate">Nat Johnson憔悴的身影出现并挡住了他的去路。 “好吧，Baines。这是你自找的。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">A pink flash blossomed. It shut out the sunlight in a single blinding burst. Baines leaped back and clawed at his coat pocket. The edge of the flash caught him and he half-fell, stunned by the force. His suit-shield sucked in the energy and discharged it, but the power rattled his teeth and for a moment he jerked like a puppet on a string. Darkness ebbed around him. He could feel the mesh of the shield glow white, as it absorbed the energy and fought to control it.</p>
                <p class="translate">一朵粉红色的闪光绽放。 它在一次令人眼盲的炸亮中挡住了阳光。 Baines向后一跳，伸手抓着他的外套口袋。 闪光的边缘抓住了他，他被力量击晕了，半倒在地。 他的防护罩服吸收了能量，又将其排出，但能量让他的牙齿嘎嘎作响，有那么一会儿，他像一根绳子上的木偶一样猛烈地抽搐。 黑暗在他周围逐渐消退。 他能感觉到防护罩的网格发出白色的光芒，它吸收了能量并努力控制它。</p>
                
                <p class="source">His own tube came out — and Johnson had no shield. "You're under arrest," Baines muttered grimly. "Put down your tube and your hands up. And call your family." He made a motion with the tube. "Come on, Johnson. Make it snappy."</p>
                <p class="translate">他自己的管子掉了出来——Johnson没有防护罩。 “你被捕了，”Baines冷酷地嘀咕道。 “放下你的管子，举起双手。然后叫上你的家人。” 他用管子做了个动作。 “来吧，Johnson。麻利点。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The lash-tube wavered and then slipped from Johnson's fingers. "You're still alive." Dawning horror crept across his face. "Then you must be —"</p>
                <p class="translate"><span class="text-to-img" data-path="../imgs/lash-tube.jpg">抽管</span>摇晃起来，然后从Johnson的手指上滑落。 “你还活着。” 黎明的恐惧爬上了他的脸。 “那你一定是——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Dave and Jean appeared. "Dad!"</p>
                <p class="translate">Dave和Jean出现了。 “爸！”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Come over here," Baines ordered. "Where's your mother?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“过来这里，”Baines命令道。 “你母亲在哪儿？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Dave jerked his head numbly. "Inside."</p>
                <p class="translate">Dave麻木地摇摇头。 “里面。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Get her and bring her here."</p>
                <p class="translate">“把她叫上并带来这里。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"You're DCA," Nat Johnson whispered.</p>
                <p class="translate">“你是 DCA，”Nat Johnson低声说道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines didn't answer. He was doing something with his neck, pulling at the flabby flesh. The wiring of a contact mike glittered as he slipped it from a fold between two chins and into his pocket. From the dirt road came the sound of motors, sleek purrs that rapidly grew louder. Two teardrops of black metal came gliding up and parked beside the house. Men swarmed out, in the dark gray-green of the Government Civil Police. In the sky swarms of black dots were descending, clouds of ugly flies that darkened the sun as they spilled out men and equipment. The men drifted slowly down.</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines没有回答。 他正在弄着脖子，拉扯松弛的肌肉。 当他将接触式麦克风从两下巴之间的折痕滑入口袋时，它的接线闪闪发光。 土路上传来马达的声音，圆滑的咕噜声迅速变大。 两滴黑色金属泪珠滑落而下，停在房子旁边。 身着政府民警深灰绿色制服的男人们蜂拥而出。 天空中，成群结队的黑点正在降落，丑陋的苍蝇云遮住了太阳，它们洒落了人员和装备。 男人们慢慢地漂下来。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"He's not here," Baines said, as the first man reached him. "He got away. Inform Wisdom back at the lab."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他不在这里，”当第一个人走到他身边时，Baines说道。 “他逃跑了。通知实验室里的Wisdom（智慧）。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"We've got this section blocked off."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我们已经封锁了这一段。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines turned to Nat Johnson, who stood in dazed silence, uncomprehending, his son and daughter beside him. "How did he know we were coming?" Baines demanded.</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines转向Nat Johnson，Nat Johnson茫然地站着，一言不发，他的儿子和女儿就在他身边。 “他怎么知道我们要来？” Baines问道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I don't know," Johnson muttered. "He just — knew."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我不知道，”Johnson嘀咕道。 “他就是 —— 知道。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"A telepath?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“心灵感应者？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I don't know."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我不知道。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines shrugged. "We'll know, soon. A clamp is out, all around here. He can't get past, no matter what the hell he can do. Unless he can dematerialize himself."</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines耸耸肩。 “我们很快就会知道。这里到处都是夹子。无论他能做什么，他都无法通过。除非他能让自己非物质化。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What'll you do with him when you — if you catch him?" Jean asked huskily.</p>
                <p class="translate">“如果你——如果你抓住了他，你会怎么处置他？” Jean哑声地问道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Study him."</p>
                <p class="translate">“研究他。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"And then kill him?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“然后杀了他？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"That depends on the lab evaluation. If you could give me more to work on, I could predict better."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这取决于实验室的评估。如果你能给我更多的信息，我就能更好地预测。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"We can't tell you anything. We don't know anything more." The girl's voice rose with desperation. "He doesn't talk."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我们什么也不能告诉你了。其它的我们都不知道了。” 少女的声音里充满了绝望。 “他不说话。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines jumped. "What?"</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines跳了起来。 “什么？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"He doesn't talk. He never talked to us. Ever."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他不说话。他从来没有和我们说过话。从来没有。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"How old is he?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“他几岁了？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Eighteen."</p>
                <p class="translate">“十八。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"No communication." Baines was sweating. "In eighteen years there hasn't been any semantic bridge between you? Does he have any contact? Signs? Codes?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“没有沟通交流。” Baines满头大汗。 “十八年来你们之间没有任何语义桥梁？他有沟通方式吗？符号？密码？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"He — ignores us. He eats here, stays with us. Sometimes he plays when we play. Or sits with us. He's gone days on end. We've never been able to find out what he's doing — or where. He sleeps in the barn — by himself."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他——无视我们。他在这里吃饭，和我们住在一起。有时我们玩的时候他也玩。或者和我们坐在一起。他连续好几天都不在。我们从来不知道他在做什么——或者在哪里。他睡觉 在谷仓里——一个人。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Is he really gold-colored?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“他真的是金色的吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Yes. Skin, eyes, hair, nails. Everything."</p>
                <p class="translate">“是的。皮肤、眼睛、头发、指甲。全部都是。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"And he's large? Well-formed?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“而且他身材高大？体格匀称？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">It was a moment before the girl answered. A strange emotion stirred her drawn features, a momentary glow. "He's incredibly beautiful. A god come down to earth." Her lips twisted. "You won't find him. He can do things. Things you have no comprehension of. Powers so far beyond your limited —"</p>
                <p class="translate">过了一会儿，女孩才回答。 一种奇怪的情绪搅动了她那憔悴的面容，瞬间焕发了光芒。 “他非常美丽。如神降临在人间。” 她的嘴唇扭曲了。 “你找不到他。他可以做一些事情。你无法理解的事情。力量远远超出你的极限——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"You don't think we'll get him?" Baines frowned. "More teams are landing all the time. You've never seen an Agency clamp in operation. We've had sixty years to work out all the bugs. If he gets away it'll be the first time —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你不认为我们会抓到他吗？” Baines皱起了眉头。 “越来越多的队伍不断登陆。你从来没有见过特工局的夹子在运作。我们花了六十年的时间来解决所有的错误。如果他逃脱了，这将是第一次——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines broke off abruptly. Three men were quickly approaching the porch. Two green-clad Civil Police. And a third man between them. A man who moved silently, lithely, a faintly luminous shape that towered above them.</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines突然停了下来。 三个人很快就来到了门廊处。 两名身穿绿衣的民警。 他们之间还有第三个人。 一个默默地、轻盈地移动的男人，一个微弱发光的身影高耸在他们之上。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Cris!" Jean screamed.</p>
                <p class="translate">“Cris！” Jean尖叫起来。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"We got him," one of the police said.</p>
                <p class="translate">“我们抓住了他，”一名警察说。</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines fingered his lash-tube uneasily. "Where? How?"</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines不安地用手指抚摸着抽管。 “哪里？怎么办到的？”</p>

                <p class="source">"He gave himself up," the policeman answered, voice full of awe. "He came to us voluntarily. Look at him. He's like a metal statue. Like some sort of — god."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他自首了。”警察回答道，声音里充满了敬畏。 “他自愿来到我们身边。看看他。他就像一座金属雕像。就像某种 —— 神。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The golden figure halted for a moment beside Jean. Then it turned slowly, calmly, to face Baines.</p>
                <p class="translate">金色的身影在Jean身边停了下来。 然后它慢慢地、平静地转向Baines。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Cris!" Jean shrieked. "Why did you come back?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“Cris！” Jean尖叫起来。 “你怎么回来了？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">The same thought was eating at Baines, too. He shoved it aside — for the time being. "Is the jet out front?" he demanded quickly.</p>
                <p class="translate">同样的想法也困惑着Baines。 他暂时把它推到一边。 “飞机在前面吗？” 他连忙问道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Ready to go," one of the CP answered.</p>
                <p class="translate">“准备好了，”一名CP（civil police民警）回答道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Fine." Baines strode past them, down the steps and onto the dirt field. "Let's go. I want him taken directly to the lab." For a moment he studied the massive figure who stood calmly between the two Civil Policemen. Beside him, they seemed to have shrunk, become ungainly and repellent. Like dwarves... What had Jean said? A god come to earth. Baines broke angrily away. "Come on," he muttered brusquely. "This one may be tough; we've never run up against one like it before. We don't know what the hell it can do."</p>
                <p class="translate">“好的。” Baines大步走过他们，走下台阶，来到泥土地上。 “走吧，我要直接把他带到实验室。” 他审视了站在两名民警之间的那个魁梧的身影。 在他身边，他们似乎都缩小了，变得笨拙而令人厌恶。 就像矮人一样……Jean说了什么？ 有神降临人间。 Baines愤怒地扯开来。 “来吧，”他粗鲁地咕哝道。 “这可能很难；我们以前从未遇到过这样的人。我们不知道它到底能做什么。”</p>

                <h2 id="part-4">Part 4</h2>
                
                <p class="source">The chamber was empty, except for the seated figure. Four bare walls, floor and ceiling. A steady glare of white light relentlessly etched every corner of the chamber. Near the top of the far wall ran a narrow slot, the view windows through which the interior of the chamber was scanned.</p>
                <p class="translate">房间是空的，只剩下坐着的人。 四堵光秃秃的墙壁、地面和天花板。 持续不断的白光无情地侵蚀着房间的每一个角落。 靠近远处墙壁的顶部有一个狭窄的缝隙，通过观察窗可以扫视房间的内部。</p>
                
                <p class="source">The seated figure was quiet. He hadn't moved since the chamber locks had slid into place, since the heavy bolts had fallen from outside and the rows of bright-faced technicians had taken their places at the view windows. He gazed down at the floor, bent forward, hands clasped together, face calm, almost expressionless. In four hours he hadn't moved a muscle.</p>
                <p class="translate">坐着的人很安静。 自从密室锁滑入到位、沉重的螺栓从外面掉下来、一排排面色明亮的技术人员在观察窗前就位以来，他就没有动过。 他低头看着地面，身体前倾，双手紧握，面容平静，几乎没有表情。 四小时内他没有动过一丝一毫。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Well?" Baines said. "What have you learned?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“所以呢？” Baines说。 “你学到了什么？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Wisdom grunted sourly. "Not much. If we don't have him doped out in forty-eight hours we'll go ahead with the euth. We can't take any chances."</p>
                <p class="translate">Wisdom酸溜溜地哼了一声。 “不多。如果我们在四十八小时内没有用药把他制伏，我们就会进行安乐死。我们不能冒险。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"You're thinking about the Tunis type," Baines said. He was, too. They had found ten of them, living in the ruins of the abandoned North African town. Their survival method was simple. They killed and absorbed other life forms, then imitated them and took their places. Chameleons, they were called. It had cost sixty lives, before the last one was destroyed. Sixty top-level experts, highly trained DCA men.</p>
                <p class="translate">“你正在考虑Tunis类型，”Baines说。 他也是。 他们已经发现了十个人，住在北非废弃小镇的废墟里。 他们的生存方法很简单。 他们杀死并吸收其他生命形式，然后模仿它们并取代它们。 他们被称为变色龙。 在最后一个被摧毁之前，它已经夺走了六十条生命。 六十名顶级专家，训练有素的 DCA 人员。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Any clues?" Baines asked.</p>
                <p class="translate">“有什么线索吗？” Baines问道。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"He's different as hell. This is going to be tough." Wisdom thumbed a pile of tape-spools. "This is the complete report, all the material we got from Johnson and his family. We pumped them with the psych-wash, then let them go home. Eighteen years — and no semantic bridge. Yet, he looks fully developed. Mature at thirteen — a shorter, faster life-cycle than ours. But why the mane? All the gold fuzz? Like a Roman monument that's been gilded."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他非常不同。这会很艰难。” Wisdom翻动着一堆磁带轴。 “这是完整的报告，是我们从Johnson和他的家人那里得到的所有材料。我们给他们进行了精神洗剂，然后让他们回家。十八年了 —— 没有语义桥梁。然而，他看起来已经完全成熟了。如十三岁般成熟 —— 比我们的生命周期更短、更快。但是为什么有鬃毛？全都是金色的绒毛？就像一座镀金的罗马纪念碑。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Has the report come in from the analysis room? You had a wave-shot taken, of course."</p>
                <p class="translate">“分析室的报告来了吗？当然，你已经拍了波电图。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"His brain pattern has been fully scanned. But it takes time for them to plot it out. We're all running around like lunatics while he just sits there!" Wisdom poked a stubby finger at the window. "We caught him easily enough. He can't have much, can he? But I'd like to know what it is. Before we euth him."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他的大脑图层已经被完全扫描了。但是他们需要时间来绘制出来。我们都像疯子一样到处乱跑，而他只是坐在那里！” Wisdom用一根粗短的手指戳着窗户。 “我们很容易抓住他。他不可能拥有太多能力，不是吗？但我想知道那是什么。在我们对他进行安乐死之前。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Maybe we should keep him alive until we know."</p>
                <p class="translate">“也许我们应该让他活着，直到我们知道为止。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Euth in forty-eight hours," Wisdom repeated stubbornly. "Whether we know or not. I don't like him. He gives me the creeps."</p>
                <p class="translate">“四十八小时内安乐死，”Wisdom固执地重复道。 “不管我们知道与否。我不喜欢他。他让我感到毛骨悚然。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Wisdom stood chewing nervously on his cigar, a red-haired, beefy-faced man, thick and heavy-set, with a barrel chest and cold, shrewd eyes deep-set in his hard face. Ed Wisdom was Director of DCA's North American Branch. But right now he was worried. His tiny eyes darted back and forth, alarmed flickers of gray in his brutal, massive face.</p>
                <p class="translate">Wisdom站在那儿，紧张地嚼着雪茄，他是一个红发、面部肌肉发达的男人，身材粗壮，胸膛呈桶形，冷酷的脸上深藏着一双冷酷而精明的眼睛。 Ed Wisdom 是 DCA 北美分公司的总监。 但现在他很担心。 他的小眼睛来回转动，在他那张残酷而巨大的脸上闪烁着惊恐的灰色。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"You think," Baines said slowly, "this is it?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你认为，”Baines缓缓地说，“就只有这些了？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I always think so," Wisdom snapped. "I have to think so."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我一直这么认为，”Wisdom厉声说道。 “我必须这么想。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I mean —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“我是说 -”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"I know what you mean." Wisdom paced back and forth, among the study tables, technicians at their benches, equipment and humming computers. Buzzing tape-slots and research hook-ups. "This thing lived eighteen years with his family and they don't understand it. They don't know what it has. They know what it does, but not how."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我明白你的意思。” Wisdom在研究桌、长凳上的技术人员、设备和嗡嗡作响的电脑之间来回踱步。 嗡嗡作响的磁带槽和研究连接。 “这个东西和他的家人一起生活了十八年，他们不理解它。他们不知道它有什么。他们知道它会什么，但不知道它是如何做的。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What does it do?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“它会啥？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"It knows things."</p>
                <p class="translate">“它知道一些事情。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What kind of things?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“什么样的事情？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Wisdom grabbed his lash-tube from his belt and tossed it on a table. "Here."</p>
                <p class="translate">Wisdom从腰带上抓起抽管，扔到桌子上。 “这里。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“什么？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Here." Wisdom signaled, and a view window was slid back an inch. "Shoot him."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这里。” Wisdom发出信号，观察窗向后滑动了一英寸。 “射他。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines blinked. "You said forty-eight hours."</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines眨了眨眼。 “你说了四十八小时的。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">With a curse, Wisdom snatched up the tube, aimed it through the window directly at the seated figure's back, and squeezed the trigger.</p>
                <p class="translate">Wisdom咒骂一声，抓起管子，透过窗户对准坐着的人的后背，扣动了扳机。</p>
                
                <p class="source">A blinding flash of pink. A cloud of energy blossomed in the center of the chamber. It sparkled, then died into dark ash.</p>
                <p class="translate">令人眼花缭乱的粉色闪光。 一股能量云在密室中央绽放。 它闪闪发光，然后消失成黑色的灰烬。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Good God!" Baines gasped. "You —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“天哪！” Baines喘着气。 “你 -”</p>
                
                <p class="source">He broke off. The figure was no longer sitting. As Wisdom fired, it had moved in a blur of speed, away from the blast, to the corner of the chamber. Now it was slowly coming back, face blank, still absorbed in thought.</p>
                <p class="translate">他停了下来。 那人不再坐着。 当Wisdom开枪时，它以模糊的速度移动，远离爆炸，来到房间的角落。 现在它慢慢回来了，面无表情，仍然沉浸在沉思中。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Fifth time," Wisdom said, as he put his tube away. "Last time Jamison and I fired together. Missed. He knew exactly when the bolts would hit. And where."</p>
                <p class="translate">“第五次了，”Wisdom一边说，一边收起了管子。 “上次Jamison和我一起开枪。没有射中。他确切地知道光束何时击中。以及击中地点。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines and Wisdom looked at each other. Both of them were thinking the same thing. "But even reading minds wouldn't tell him where they were going to hit," Baines said. "When, maybe. But not where. Could you have called your own shots?"</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines和Wisdom对视一眼。 两人心里都在想同一件事。 “但即使是读心术也不会告诉他他们会击中哪里，”Baines说。 “也许是在什么时候。但不是在哪里。你能自己决定射哪吗？”</p>    
                
                <p class="source">"Not mine," Wisdom answered flatly. "I fired fast, damn near at random." He frowned. "Random. We'll have to make a test of this." He waved a group of technicians over. "Get a construction team up here. On the double." He grabbed paper and pen and began sketching.</p>
                <p class="translate">“不是我的。”Wisdom斩钉截铁地回答。 “我开枪速度很快，几乎是随机的。” 他皱起了眉头。 “随机的。我们必须对此进行测试。” 他挥手示意一群技术人员过来。 “派一支建筑队到这里来。双线。” 他抓起纸和笔开始画草图。</p>

                <h2 id="part-5">Part 5</h2>
                
                <p class="source">While construction was going on, Baines met his fiancee in the lobby outside the lab, the great central lounge of the DCA Building.</p>
                <p class="translate">施工期间，Baines在实验室外的大厅（DCA 大楼的中央休息室）见了他的未婚妻。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"How's it coming?" she asked. Anita Ferris was tall and blonde, blue eyes and a mature, carefully cultivated figure. An attractive, competent-looking woman in her late twenties. She wore a metal foil dress and cape with a red and black stripe on the sleeve, the emblem of the A-Class. Anita was Director of the Semantics Agency, a top-level Government Coordinator. "Anything of interest, this time?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“怎么样了？” 她问。 Anita Ferris身材高挑，金发碧眼，有着成熟、精心塑造的身材。 一位二十多岁、看上去很有魅力、很有能力的女人。 她穿着金属箔连衣裙和斗篷，袖子上有红黑条纹，这是A级的标志。 Anita是语义局局长，一个高级政府协调员。 “这次有什么有趣的事吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Plenty." Baines guided her from the lobby, into the dim recess of the bar. Music played softly in the background, a shifting variety of patterns formed mathematically. Dim shapes moved expertly through the gloom, from table to table. Silent, efficient robot waiters.</p>
                <p class="translate">“很多。” Baines领着她离开大厅，走进酒吧昏暗的凹处。 背景音乐轻柔地播放，各种变化的模式以数学方式形成。 昏暗的灯光中，昏暗的身影熟练地从一张桌子移动到另一张桌子。 安静、高效的机器人服务员。</p>
                
                <p class="source">As Anita sipped her Tom Collins, Baines outlined what they had found.</p>
                <p class="translate">当Anita喝着Tom Collins(鸡尾酒)时，Baines概述了他们的发现。</p>
                
                <p class="source">"What are the chances," Anita asked slowly, "that he's built up some kind of deflection-cone? There was one kind that warped their environment by direct mental effort. No tools. Direct mind to matter."</p>
                <p class="translate">“有多大可能，”Anita慢慢地问道，“他建造了某种偏转锥体？有一种通过直接的精神力来扭曲他们的环境。没有工具。直接用精神力思考物质。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Psychokinetics?" Baines drummed restlessly on the table top. "I doubt it. The thing has ability to predict, not to control. He can't stop the beams, but he can sure as hell get out of the way."</p>
                <p class="translate">“心灵动力学？” Baines不安地敲着桌面。 “我对此表示怀疑。这东西有预测能力，但没有控制能力。他无法阻止光束，但他绝对可以闪开。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Does he jump between the molecules?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“他会在分子之间跳跃吗？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines wasn't amused. "This is serious. We've handled these things sixty years — longer than you and I have been around added together. Eighty-seven types of deviants have shown up, real mutants that could reproduce themselves, not mere freaks. This is the eighty-eighth. We've been able to handle each of them in turn. But this —"</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines并没有被逗乐。 “这很严重。我们处理这些事情已经有六十年了 —— 比你我存在的时间加起来还要长。已经出现了八十七种变种人，是真正能够自我繁殖的变种人，而不是单纯的怪胎。这就是第八十八种变种人。我们已经能够依次处理它们了。但是这个 ——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Why are you so worried about this one?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你为什么这么担心这个？”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"First, it's eighteen years old. That in itself is incredible. Its family managed to hide it that long."</p>
                <p class="translate">“首先，它已经十八岁了。这本身就令人难以置信。它的家人设法将它隐藏了那么久。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Those women around Denver were older than that. Those ones with —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“Denver附近的那些女人都比那年长。那些——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"They were in a Government camp. Somebody high up was toying with the idea of allowing them to breed. Some sort of industrial use. We withheld euth for years. But Cris Johnson stayed alive outside our control. Those things at Denver were under constant scrutiny."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他们在政府营地里。高层有人正在考虑允许他们繁殖。某种工业用途。我们多年来一直没有对他们进行安乐死。但Cris Johnson在我们的控制之外仍然活着。在Denver的他们一直处于持续审查状态。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Maybe he's harmless. You always assume a deeve is a menace. He might even be beneficial. Somebody thought those women might work in. Maybe this thing has something that would advance the race."</p>
                <p class="translate">“也许他是无害的。你总是认为deeve是一种威胁。他甚至可能是有益的。有人认为那些女人可能会工作。也许这个东西有一些可以推动种族进化的作用。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"Which race? Not the human race. It's the old 'the operation was a success but the patient died' routine. If we introduce a mutant to keep us going it'll be mutants, not us, who'll inherit the earth. It'll be mutants surviving for their own sake. Don't think for a moment we can put padlocks on them and expect them to serve us. If they're really superior to homo sapiens, they'll win out in even competition. To survive, we've got to cold-deck them right from the start."</p>
                <p class="translate">“哪个种族？不是人类。这是‘手术成功，但病人死了’的老套路。如果我们引入一个变种人来让我们继续前进，那么继承地球的将是变种人，而不是我们。” 变种人会为了自己的利益而生存。暂时不要以为我们可以给他们戴上挂锁，然后指望他们为我们服务。如果他们真的比智人优越，他们就会在平等的竞争中获胜。 为了生存，我们必须从一开始就对它们耍诈。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"In other words, we'll know homo superior when he comes — by definition. He'll be the one we won't be able to euth."</p>
                <p class="translate">“换句话来说，当他到来时我们就会知道优越者——根据定义。他将是我们无法安乐死的人。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"That's about it," Baines answered. "Assuming there is a homo superior. Maybe there's just homo peculiar. Homo with an improved line."</p>
                <p class="translate">“就是这样，”Baines回答道。 “假设有一个优越的人类。也许只是人类特有的。具有改良血统的人类。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"The Neanderthal probably thought the Cro-Magnon man had merely an improved line. A little more advanced ability to conjure up symbols and shape flint. From your description, this thing is more radical than a mere improvement."</p>
                <p class="translate">“Neanderthal人可能认为Cro-Magnon人只是改良了血脉。更先进一点的能力，可以召唤符号和塑造燧石。从你的描述来看，这东西比单纯的改良更激进。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">"This thing," Baines said slowly, "has an ability to predict. So far, it's been able to stay alive. It's been able to cope with situations better than you or I could. How long do you think we'd stay alive in that chamber, with energy beams blazing down at us? In a sense it's got the ultimate survival ability. If it can always be accurate —"</p>
                <p class="translate">“这东西，”Baines缓缓说道，“具有预测能力。到目前为止，它能够存活下来。它能够比你我更好地应对各种情况。你认为我们还能存活多久 在那个房间里，如果能量束向我们猛烈射来的话？从某种意义上说，它拥有终极的生存能力。如果它能永远准确的话——”</p>
                
                <p class="source">A wall-speaker sounded. "Baines, you're wanted in the lab. Get the hell out of the bar and upramp."</p>
                <p class="translate">墙上的扬声器响起。 “Baines，实验室里需要你。赶紧离开酒吧，上这来。”</p>
                
                <p class="source">Baines pushed back his chair and got to his feet. "Come along. You may be interested in seeing what Wisdom has got dreamed up."</p>
                <p class="translate">Baines推开椅子，站了起来。 “来吧。你可能有兴趣看看Wisdom想出了什么主意。”</p>
