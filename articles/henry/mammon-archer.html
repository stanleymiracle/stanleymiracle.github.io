                <h1>Mammon and the Archer (拜金与弓箭手)</h1>
                <div class="author">O. Henry</div>

                <p class="source">Old Anthony Rockwall, retired manufacturer and proprietor of Rockwall's Eureka Soap, looked out the library window of his Fifth Avenue mansion and grinned. His neighbour to the right--the aristocratic clubman, G. Van Schuylight Suffolk-Jones--came out to his waiting motor-car, wrinkling a contumelious nostril, as usual, at the Italian renaissance sculpture of the soap palace's front elevation.</p>
                <p class="translate">老Anthony Rockwall是一位退休的制造商，也是Rockwall的 Eureka肥皂的老板，他从第五大道豪宅的图书馆窗户往外看，咧嘴一笑。 他右边的邻居 —— 贵族俱乐部成员G. Van Schuylight Suffolk-Jones —— 来到了他等候的汽车前，像往常一样，在肥皂宫正面的意大利文艺复兴时期雕塑前皱起了傲慢的鼻孔。</p>

                <p class="source">"Stuck-up old statuette of nothing doing!" commented the ex-Soap King. "The Eden Musee'll get that old frozen Nesselrode yet if he don't watch out. I'll have this house painted red, white, and blue next summer and see if that'll make his Dutch nose turn up any higher."</p>
                <p class="translate">“无所事事的顽固老雕像！” 前肥皂大王评论道。 “如果他不小心的话，伊甸博物馆就会得到那座旧的冰冻Nesselrode。明年夏天我会把这座房子漆成红色、白色和蓝色，看看这是否会让他的荷兰鼻子变得更高。 ”</p>

                <p class="source">And then Anthony Rockwall, who never cared for bells, went to the door of his library and shouted "Mike!" in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the Kansas prairies.</p>
                <p class="translate">然后，从不关心铃声的Anthony Rockwall走到他的图书馆门口，用了曾经把Kansas大草原上的韦尔金削成碎片一样的声音大喊“Mike！”。</p>

                <p class="source">"Tell my son," said Anthony to the answering menial, "to come in here before he leaves the house."</p>
                <p class="translate">“告诉我的儿子，”Anthony对回应的仆人说，“让他在离开房子之前到这里来。”</p>

                <p class="source">When young Rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his newspaper, looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big, smooth, ruddy countenance, rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other.</p>
                <p class="translate">当年轻的Rockwall走进图书馆时，老人把报纸放在一边，他那张光滑、红润的大脸上带着慈祥而严肃的表情看着他，一只手揉乱了他那乱糟糟的白发，另一只手把口袋里的钥匙敲得嘎嘎作响。</p>

                <p class="source">"Richard," said Anthony Rockwall, "what do you pay for the soap that you use?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“Richard，”Anthony Rockwall说，“你用的肥皂多少钱？”</p>

                <p class="source">Richard, only six months home from college, was startled a little. He had not yet taken the measure of this sire of his, who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party.</p>
                <p class="translate">Richard刚从大学毕业六个月就回家了，他有点吃惊。 他还没有衡量过他的父亲，他就像一个初次参加聚会的女孩一样充满了意外。</p>

                <p class="source">"Six dollars a dozen, I think, dad."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我想六美元一打，爸爸。”</p>

                <p class="source">"And your clothes?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你的衣服呢？”</p>

                <p class="source">"I suppose about sixty dollars, as a rule."</p>
                <p class="translate">“一般来说，我想大约是六十美元。”</p>

                <p class="source">"You're a gentleman," said Anthony, decidedly. "I've heard of these young bloods spending $24 a dozen for soap, and going over the hundred mark for clothes. You've got as much money to waste as any of 'em, and yet you stick to what's decent and moderate. Now I use the old Eureka--not only for sentiment, but it's the purest soap made. Whenever you pay more than 10 cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels. But 50 cents is doing very well for a young man in your generation, position and condition. As I said, you're a gentleman. They say it takes three generations to make one. They're off. Money'll do it as slick as soap grease. It's made you one. By hokey! it's almost made one of me. I'm nearly as impolite and disagreeable and ill-mannered as these two old Knickerbocker gents on each side of me that can't sleep of nights because I bought in between 'em."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你是一位绅士，”Anthony斩钉截铁地说。 “我听说一些年轻人买肥皂要花 24 美元一打，买衣服要花上百。你和他们一样有很多钱可以浪费，但你却坚持穿得体和适度的东西。 现在我用旧的Eureka肥皂 —— 不仅是为了情调，而且它是最纯净的肥皂。每当你花超过 10 美分买一块肥皂时，你就会买到劣质的香水和标签。但 50 美分对于一个年轻人来说已经很不错了。 你的世代、地位和条件。正如我所说，你是一位绅士。他们说需要三代人才能造就一位绅士。他们错了。金钱会像肥皂油脂一样光滑。它让你成为一位做作的绅士。这几乎成了我的一部分。我几乎和我两边的这两个Knickerbocker老绅士一样不礼貌、令人讨厌和无礼，他们晚上睡不着觉，因为我在他们中间买了东西。”</p>

                <p class="source">"There are some things that money can't accomplish," remarked young Rockwall, rather gloomily.</p>
                <p class="translate">“有些事情是金钱无法完成的，”年轻的Rockwall相当沮丧地说道。</p>

                <p class="source">"Now, don't say that," said old Anthony, shocked. "I bet my money on money every time. I've been through the encyclopaedia down to Y looking for something you can't buy with it; and I expect to have to take up the appendix next week. I'm for money against the field. Tell me something money won't buy."</p>
                <p class="translate">“现在，别这么说，”老Anthony震惊地说。 “我每次都把钱赌在金钱上。我已经翻阅了百科全书，一直在寻找用它买不到的东西；我预计下周必须讨论附录。我支持金钱对抗领域。告诉我一些金钱买不到的东西。”</p>

                <p class="source">"For one thing," answered Richard, rankling a little, "it won't buy one into the exclusive circles of society." "Oho! won't it?" thundered the champion of the root of evil. "You tell me where your exclusive circles would be if the first Astor hadn't had the money to pay for his steerage passage over?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“一方面，”Richard回答说，有点恼火，“它不会让一个人进入社会的专属圈子。” “噢！不会吧？” 邪恶之根的拥护者怒吼道。 “你告诉我，如果第一个Astor没有钱支付他的统舱费用，你的专属圈子会在哪里？”</p>

                <p class="source">Richard sighed.</p>
                <p class="translate">Richard叹了口气。</p>

                <p class="source">"And that's what I was coming to," said the old man, less boisterously. "That's why I asked you to come in. There's something going wrong with you, boy. I've been noticing it for two weeks. Out with it. I guess I could lay my hands on eleven millions within twenty-four hours, besides the real estate. If it's your liver, there's the Rambler down in the bay, coaled, and ready to steam down to the Bahamas in two days."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这就是我的目的，”老人说道，语气不那么喧闹了。 “这就是为什么我请你进来。你有问题，孩子。我已经注意到两个星期了。出去吧。除了房地产之外，我想我可以在二十四小时内拿到一千一百万。如果是你的肝脏，海湾里就有 Rambler，加了煤，准备在两天内驶往Bahamas。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Not a bad guess, dad; you haven't missed it far."</p>
                <p class="translate">“猜得不错，爸爸；你并没有错过太多。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Ah," said Anthony, keenly; "what's her name?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“啊，”Anthony敏锐地说。 “她叫什么名字？”</p>

                <p class="source">Richard began to walk up and down the library floor. There was enough comradeship and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his confidence.</p>
                <p class="translate">Richard开始在图书馆的地板上走来走去。 他这位粗鲁的老父亲身上有足够的情谊和同情心，足以赢得他的信任。</p>

                <p class="source">"Why don't you ask her?" demanded old Anthony. "She'll jump at you. You've got the money and the looks, and you're a decent boy. Your hands are clean. You've got no Eureka soap on 'em. You've been to college, but she'll overlook that."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你为什么不问问她？” 老Anthony问道。 “她会向你扑来。你有钱有貌，而且是个正派的男孩。你的手脚干净。你身上没有Eureka肥皂。你上过大学，但是她会忽略这一点。”</p>

                <p class="source">"I haven't had a chance," said Richard.</p>
                <p class="translate">“我没有机会，”Richard说。</p>

                <p class="source">"Make one," said Anthony. "Take her for a walk in the park, or a straw ride, or walk home with her from church Chance! Pshaw!"</p>
                <p class="translate">“造一个，”安东尼说。 “带她去公园散步，或者骑稻草车，或者和她从 Chance 教堂步行回家！噗！”</p>

                <p class="source">"You don't know the social mill, dad. She's part of the stream that turns it. Every hour and minute of her time is arranged for days in advance. I must have that girl, dad, or this town is a blackjack swamp forevermore. And I can't write it--I can't do that."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你不了解社交厂，爸爸。她是推动社会运转的溪流的一部分。她的每一小时每一分钟都是提前几天安排好的。我必须拥有那个女孩，爸爸，否则这个小镇永远就是一个二十一点沼泽。我写不出来 —— 我做不到。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Tut!" said the old man. "Do you mean to tell me that with all the money I've got you can't get an hour or two of a girl's time for yourself?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“啧！” 老人说道。 “你的意思是说，以我所有的钱，你也无法得到一个女孩的一两个小时的独处时间吗？”</p>

                <p class="source">"I've put it off too late. She's going to sail for Europe at noon day after to-morrow for a two years' stay. I'm to see her alone tomorrow evening for a few minutes. She's at Larchmont now at her aunt's. I can't go there. But I'm allowed to meet her with a cab at the Grand Central Station to-morrow evening at the 8.30 train. We drive down Broadway to Wallack's at a gallop, where her mother and a box party will be waiting for us in the lobby. Do you think she would listen to a declaration from me during that six or eight minutes under those circumstances? No. And what chance would I have in the theatre or afterward? None. No, dad, this is one tangle that your money can't unravel. We can't buy one minute of time with cash; if we could, rich people would live longer. There's no hope of getting a talk with Miss Lantry before she sails."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我推迟得太晚了。她后天中午就要启程去欧洲，在那里待两年。明天晚上我要单独见她几分钟。她现在在Larchmont。” 在她姨妈家。我不能去那里。但我被允许在明天晚上 8 点 30 分的火车上在大中央车站乘出租车去见她。我们沿着百老汇疾驰到Wallack家，她的母亲和 大厅里将会有一场包厢派对在等着我们。在这种情况下，你认为她会在那六八分钟内听我的声明吗？不会。那我在剧院或之后还有什么机会？不会。不会。 爸爸，这是你的钱无法解开的一个纠结。我们不能用现金买到一分钟的时间；如果可以的话，富人会活得更久。在Lantry小姐启程之前，没有希望与她交谈 ”。</p>

                <p class="source">"All right, Richard, my boy," said old Anthony, cheerfully. "You may run along down to your club now. I'm glad it ain't your liver. But don't forget to burn a few punk sticks in the joss house to the great god Mazuma from time to time. You say money won't buy time? Well, of course, you can't order eternity wrapped up and delivered at your residence for a price, but I've seen Father Time get pretty bad stone bruises on his heels when he walked through the gold diggings."</p>
                <p class="translate">“好吧，Richard，我的孩子，”老Anthony高兴地说。 “你现在可以跑去你的俱乐部了。我很高兴那不是你的肝脏。但是别忘了时不时地在庙里给伟大的Mazuma神烧几根朋克棒。你说钱买不到时间？好吧，当然，你不能以高价订购永恒的包裹并交付到你的住所，但我见过时间父亲在走过金矿时脚后跟受到了严重的石头瘀伤 ”。</p>

                <p class="source">That night came Aunt Ellen, gentle, sentimental, wrinkled, sighing, oppressed by wealth, in to Brother Anthony at his evening paper, and began discourse on the subject of lovers' woes.</p>
                <p class="translate">那天晚上，Ellen姨妈温柔、多愁善感，满脸皱纹，叹息着，饱受财富的压迫，来到Anthony弟兄面前，看他的晚报，开始谈论恋人的烦恼。</p>

                <p class="source">"He told me all about it," said brother Anthony, yawning. "I told him my bank account was at his service. And then he began to knock money. Said money couldn't help. Said the rules of society couldn't be bucked for a yard by a team of ten-millionaires."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他把这一切都告诉了我，”弟弟Anthony打着哈欠说道。 “我告诉他我的银行账户是为他服务的。然后他就开始敲着钱。说钱没用。说社会规则不能被千万富翁们违背。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Oh, Anthony," sighed Aunt Ellen, "I wish you would not think so much of money. Wealth is nothing where a true affection is concerned. Love is all-powerful. If he only had spoken earlier! She could not have refused our Richard. But now I fear it is too late. He will have no opportunity to address her. All your gold cannot bring happiness to your son."</p>
                <p class="translate">“哦，Anthony，”Ellen姨妈叹了口气，“我希望你不要把钱想得那么重要。对于真正的感情来说，财富根本不算什么。爱是万能的。要是他早点开口就好了！她不可能拒绝我们的Richard。但现在我担心为时已晚。他将没有机会向她讲话。你所有的金子都无法给你的儿子带来幸福。”</p>

                <p class="source">At eight o'clock the next evening Aunt Ellen took a quaint old gold ring from a moth-eaten case and gave it to Richard.</p>
                <p class="translate">第二天晚上八点，Ellen姨妈从一个被虫蛀的盒子里取出一枚古色古香的旧金戒指，交给了Richard。</p>

                <p class="source">"Wear it to-night, nephew," she begged. "Your mother gave it to me. Good luck in love she said it brought. She asked me to give it to you when you had found the one you loved."</p>
                <p class="translate">“今晚戴上它，侄子，”她恳求道。 “你妈妈把它给了我。她说它会带来爱情好运。当你找到你所爱的人时，她让我把它给你。”</p>

                <p class="source">Young Rockwall took the ring reverently and tried it on his smallest finger. It slipped as far as the second joint and stopped. He took it off and stuffed it into his vest pocket, after the manner of man. And then he 'phoned for his cab.</p>
                <p class="translate">年轻的Rockwall恭敬地接过戒指，在他最小的手指上试了一下。 它滑到第二个关节处就停了下来。 他把它脱下来，按照男人的方式塞进背心口袋里。 然后他打电话叫出租车。</p>

                <p class="source">At the station he captured Miss Lantry out of the gadding mob at eight thirty-two.</p>
                <p class="translate">八点三十二分，他在车站把Lantry小姐从熙熙攘攘的人群中截了出来。</p>

                <p class="source">"We mustn't keep mamma and the others waiting," said she.</p>
                <p class="translate">“我们不能让妈妈和其他人久等了，”她说。</p>

                <p class="source">"To Wallack's Theatre as fast as you can drive!" said Richard loyally.</p>
                <p class="translate">“尽可能快地开车去Wallack剧院！” Richard忠诚地说。</p>

                <p class="source">They whirled up Forty-second to Broadway, and then down the white- starred lane that leads from the soft meadows of sunset to the rocky hills of morning.</p>
                <p class="translate">他们沿着四十二号公路急速驶向百老汇，然后沿着白星小路行驶，这条小路从日落的柔软草地一直延伸到早晨的岩石山丘。</p>

                <p class="source">At Thirty-fourth Street young Richard quickly thrust up the trap and ordered the cabman to stop.</p>
                <p class="translate">在三十四街，年轻的Richard迅速推开门栓，命令车夫把车停下来。</p>

                <p class="source">"I've dropped a ring," he apo1ogised, as he climbed out. "It was my mother's, and I'd hate to lose it. I won't detain you a minute--I saw where it fell."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我的戒指掉了，”他爬下车时道歉。 “那是我母亲的，我不想失去它。我不会耽搁你一分钟——我看到它掉在哪里了。”</p>

                <p class="source">In less than a minute he was back in the cab with the ring.</p>
                <p class="translate">不到一分钟，他就带着戒指回到了出租车里。</p>

                <p class="source">But within that minute a crosstown car had stopped directly in front of the cab. The cabman tried to pass to the left, but a heavy express wagon cut him off. He tried the right, and had to back away from a furniture van that had no business to be there. He tried to back out, but dropped his reins and swore dutifully. He was blockaded in a tangled mess of vehicles and horses.</p>
                <p class="translate">但不到一分钟，一辆跨城汽车就停在了出租车前面。 出租车司机试图从左边超车，但一辆重型特快货车挡住了他。 他尝试向右走，但不得不从一辆无权停在那里的家具车旁退了回来。 他试图后退，但还是放下了缰绳，尽职尽责地咒骂着。 他被困在车马杂乱之中。</p>

                <p class="source">One of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up commerce and movement quite suddenly in the big city.</p>
                <p class="translate">其中一次发生的街道封锁有时会突然阻碍大城市的商业和交通。</p>

                <p class="source">"Why don't you drive on?" said Miss Lantry, impatiently. "We'll be late."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你为什么不继续开车？” Lantry小姐不耐烦地说。 “我们快迟到了。”</p>

                <p class="source">Richard stood up in the cab and looked around. He saw a congested flood of wagons, trucks, cabs, vans and street cars filling the vast space where Broadway, Sixth Avenue and Thirly-fourth street cross one another as a twenty-six inch maiden fills her twenty-two inch girdle. And still from all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward the converging point at full speed, and hurling thcmselves into the struggling mass, locking wheels and adding their drivers' imprecations to the clamour. The entire traffic of Manhattan seemed to have jammed itself around them. The oldest New Yorker among the thousands of spectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade of the proportions of this one.</p>
                <p class="translate">Richard在驾驶室里站起来，环顾四周。 他看到一大群拥挤的马车、卡车、出租车、货车和有轨电车挤满了百老汇、第六大道和第三第四街相互交叉的广阔空间，就像一个二十六英寸的少女在她二十二英寸的腰带上填满一样。 他们仍然从各个十字路口全速冲向汇合点，冲进拥挤的人群，车轮锁死，司机的咒骂声也加入了喧嚣之中。 整个曼哈顿的交通似乎都拥堵在他们周围。 人行道上数千名观众中最年长的纽约人从未目睹过如此大规模的街道封锁。</p>

                <p class="source">"I'm very sorry," said Richard, as he resumed his seat, "but it looks as if we are stuck. They won't get this jumble loosened up in an hour. It was my fault. If I hadn't dropped the ring we--"Let me see the ring," said Miss Lantry. "Now that it can't be helped, I don't care. I think theatres are stupid, anyway."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我很抱歉，”Richard坐回座位上说道，“但看来我们被困住了。他们一个小时内将无法解决这个混乱问题。这是我的错。如果我没把戒指掉在地上 —— “让我看看戒指，”Lantry小姐说，“现在已经无能为力了，我不在乎。 反正，我觉得剧院都是愚蠢的。”</p>

                <p class="source">At 11 o'clock that night somebody tapped lightly on Anthony Rockwall's door.</p>
                <p class="translate">那天晚上 11 点，有人轻轻敲响了Anthony Rockwall的门。</p>

                <p class="source">"Come in," shouted Anthony, who was in a red dressing-gown, reading a book of piratical adventures.</p>
                <p class="translate">“进来，”Anthony喊道，他穿着红色晨衣，正在读一本海盗冒险书。</p>

                <p class="source">Somebody was Aunt Ellen, looking like a grey-haired angel that had been left on earth by mistake.</p>
                <p class="translate">那人就是Ellen阿姨，她看起来就像一个被错误地留在地球上的白发天使。</p>

                <p class="source">"They're engaged, Anthony," she said, softly. "She has promised to marry our Richard. On their way to the theatre there was a street blockade, and it was two hours before their cab could get out of it.</p>
                <p class="translate">“他们订婚了，Anthony，”她轻声说道。 “她已经答应嫁给我们的Richard了。在他们去剧院的路上，街道被封锁了，他们的出租车花了两个小时才从那里出来。</p>

                <p class="source">"And oh, brother Anthony, don't ever boast of the power of money again. A little emblem of true love--a little ring that symbolised unending and unmercenary affection--was the cause of our Richard finding his happiness. He dropped it in the street, and got out to recover it. And before they could continue the blockade occurred. He spoke to his love and won her there while the cab was hemmed in. Money is dross compared with true love, Anthony."</p>
                <p class="translate">“哦，Anthony兄弟，不要再吹嘘金钱的力量了。一个真爱的小象征 —— 一枚象征着无尽和不求回报的感情的小戒指 —— 是我们的Richard找到幸福的原因。“他把它掉在街上，他下车去取回它。他们还没来得及继续，封锁就发生了。他和他的爱人说话，并在出租车被围困的时候赢得了她。与真爱相比，金钱是渣滓，Anthony。”</p>

                <p class="source">"All right," said old Anthony. "I'm glad the boy has got what he wanted. I told him I wouldn't spare any expense in the matter if--"</p>
                <p class="translate">“好吧，”老Anthony说。 “我很高兴这个男孩得到了他想要的。我告诉他我不会在这件事上不惜一切代价，如果——”</p>

                <p class="source">"But, brother Anthony, what good could your money have done?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“但是，Anthony兄弟，你的钱能有什么用呢？”</p>

                <p class="source">"Sister," said Anthony Rockwall. "I've got my pirate in a devil of a scrape. His ship has just been scuttled, and he's too good a judge of the value of money to let drown. I wish you would let me go on with this chapter."</p>
                <p class="translate">“姐姐，”Anthony Rockwall说。 “我的海盗陷入了困境。他的船刚刚被凿沉，他对金钱的价值判断能力太强了，不能让他淹死。我希望你能让我继续这一章。”</p>

                <p class="source">The story should end here. I wish it would as heartily as you who read it wish it did. But we must go to the bottom of the well for truth.</p>
                <p class="translate">故事到这里就该结束了。 我希望它能像你衷心地读它一样希望它这样发生。 但我们必须把真相寻找到底。</p>

                <p class="source">The next day a person with red hands and a blue polka-dot necktie, who called himself Kelly, called at Anthony Rockwall's house, and was at once received in the library.</p>
                <p class="translate">第二天，一个红手、系蓝色圆点领带、自称Kelly的人到Anthony Rockwall家拜访，立刻就被接待进了图书馆。</p>

                <p class="source">"Well," said Anthony, reaching for his chequebook, "it was a good bilin' of soap. Let's see--you had $5,000 in cash."</p>
                <p class="translate">“嗯，”Anthony说，伸手去拿他的支票簿，“这是一大笔肥皂费。让我们看看 —— 你有 5000 美元现金。”</p>

                <p class="source">"I paid out $3OO more of my own," said Kelly. "I had to go a little above the estimate. I got the express wagons and cabs mostly for $5; but the trucks and two-horse teams mostly raised me to $10. The motormen wanted $10, and some of the loaded teams $20. The cops struck me hardest--$50 I paid two, and the rest $20 and $25. But didn't it work beautiful, Mr. Rockwall? I'm glad William A. Brady wasn't onto that little outdoor vehicle mob scene. I wouldn't want William to break his heart with jealousy. And never a rehearsal, either! The boys was on time to the fraction of a second. It was two hours before a snake could get below Greeley's statue."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我自己多付了 300 美元，”Kelly说。 “我不得不比预估的价格高一点。我买的快车和出租车大多是 5 美元；但卡车和两匹马车队大多给我加价到 10 美元。汽车司机要 10 美元，一些满载的车队要 20 美元。 警察对我打击最重 —— 50 美元，我付了两份，剩下的 20 美元和 25 美元。但是这不是很好吗，Rockwall先生？我很高兴William·A·Brady没有参与那个小小的户外车辆暴徒场景。我 不想让William因嫉妒而心碎。而且也从来没有排练过！男孩们准时到了毫厘。两个小时后，一条蛇才能爬到Greeley的雕像下面。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Thirteen hundred--there you are, Kelly," said Anthony, tearing off a check. "Your thousand, and the $300 you were out. You don't despise money, do you, Kelly?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“一千三百 —— 给你，Kelly，”Anthony说着，撕下一张支票。 “你的一千，还有你花掉的三百美元。你并不轻视金钱，是吗，Kelly？”</p>

                <p class="source">"Me?" said Kelly. "I can lick the man that invented poverty."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我？” Kelly说。 “我可以舔那个发明贫困的人。”</p>

                <p class="source">Anthony called Kelly when he was at the door.</p>
                <p class="translate">Kelly在门口时给Anthony叫住了。</p>

                <p class="source">"You didn't notice," said he, "anywhere in the tie-up, a kind of a fat boy without any clothes on shooting arrows around with a bow, did you?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你没有注意到，”他说，“在任何被围困地方，有一个没穿衣服的胖男孩，拿着弓到处射箭，是吗？”</p>

                <p class="source">"Why, no," said Kelly, mystified. "I didn't. If he was like you say, maybe the cops pinched him before I got there."</p>
                <p class="translate">“为什么，没有啊，”Kelly困惑地说。 “我没有。如果他像你说的那样，也许警察在我到达那里之前就按住了他。”</p>

                <p class="source">"I thought the little rascal wouldn't be on hand," chuckled Anthony. "Good-by, Kelly."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我还以为那个小流氓没有随时待命呢。”Anthony笑着说。 “再见，Kelly。”</p>
