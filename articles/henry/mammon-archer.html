                <h1>Mammon and the Archer (Mammon与弓箭手)</h1>
                <div class="author">O. Henry</div>

                <p class="source">Old Anthony Rockwall, retired manufacturer and proprietor of Rockwall's Eureka Soap, looked out the library window of his Fifth Avenue mansion and grinned. His neighbour to the right--the aristocratic clubman, G. Van Schuylight Suffolk-Jones--came out to his waiting motor-car, wrinkling a contumelious nostril, as usual, at the Italian renaissance sculpture of the soap palace's front elevation.</p>
                <p class="translate">老Anthony Rockwall是一位退休的制造商，也是Rockwall的 Eureka肥皂的老板，他从第五大道豪宅的图书馆窗户往外看，咧嘴一笑。 他右边的邻居 —— 贵族俱乐部成员G. Van Schuylight Suffolk-Jones —— 来到了他等候的汽车前，像往常一样，在肥皂宫正面的意大利文艺复兴时期雕塑前皱起了傲慢的鼻孔。</p>

                <p class="source">"Stuck-up old statuette of nothing doing!" commented the ex-Soap King. "The Eden Musee'll get that old frozen Nesselrode yet if he don't watch out. I'll have this house painted red, white, and blue next summer and see if that'll make his Dutch nose turn up any higher."</p>
                <p class="translate">“无所事事的顽固老雕像！” 前肥皂大王评论道。 “如果他不小心的话，伊甸博物馆就会得到那座旧的冰冻Nesselrode。明年夏天我会把这座房子漆成红色、白色和蓝色，看看这是否会让他的荷兰鼻子变得更高。 ”</p>

                <p class="source">And then Anthony Rockwall, who never cared for bells, went to the door of his library and shouted "Mike!" in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the Kansas prairies.</p>
                <p class="translate">然后，从不关心铃声的Anthony Rockwall走到他的图书馆门口，用了曾经把Kansas大草原上的韦尔金削成碎片一样的声音大喊“Mike！”。</p>

                <p class="source">"Tell my son," said Anthony to the answering menial, "to come in here before he leaves the house."</p>
                <p class="translate">“告诉我的儿子，”Anthony对回应的仆人说，“让他在离开房子之前到这里来。”</p>

                <p class="source">When young Rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his newspaper, looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big, smooth, ruddy countenance, rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other.</p>
                <p class="translate">当年轻的Rockwall走进图书馆时，老人把报纸放在一边，他那张光滑、红润的大脸上带着慈祥而严肃的表情看着他，一只手揉乱了他那乱糟糟的白发，另一只手把口袋里的钥匙敲得嘎嘎作响。</p>

                <p class="source">"Richard," said Anthony Rockwall, "what do you pay for the soap that you use?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“Richard，”Anthony Rockwall说，“你用的肥皂多少钱？”</p>

                <p class="source">Richard, only six months home from college, was startled a little. He had not yet taken the measure of this sire of his, who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party.</p>
                <p class="translate">Richard刚从大学毕业六个月就回家了，他有点吃惊。 他还没有衡量过他的父亲，他就像一个初次参加聚会的女孩一样充满了意外。</p>

                <p class="source">"Six dollars a dozen, I think, dad."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我想六美元一打，爸爸。”</p>

                <p class="source">"And your clothes?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你的衣服呢？”</p>

                <p class="source">"I suppose about sixty dollars, as a rule."</p>
                <p class="translate">“一般来说，我想大约是六十美元。”</p>

                <p class="source">"You're a gentleman," said Anthony, decidedly. "I've heard of these young bloods spending $24 a dozen for soap, and going over the hundred mark for clothes. You've got as much money to waste as any of 'em, and yet you stick to what's decent and moderate. Now I use the old Eureka--not only for sentiment, but it's the purest soap made. Whenever you pay more than 10 cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels. But 50 cents is doing very well for a young man in your generation, position and condition. As I said, you're a gentleman. They say it takes three generations to make one. They're off. Money'll do it as slick as soap grease. It's made you one. By hokey! it's almost made one of me. I'm nearly as impolite and disagreeable and ill-mannered as these two old Knickerbocker gents on each side of me that can't sleep of nights because I bought in between 'em."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你是一位绅士，”Anthony斩钉截铁地说。 “我听说一些年轻人买肥皂要花 24 美元一打，买衣服要花上百。你和他们一样有很多钱可以浪费，但你却坚持穿得体和适度的东西。 现在我用旧的Eureka肥皂 —— 不仅是为了情调，而且它是最纯净的肥皂。每当你花超过 10 美分买一块肥皂时，你就会买到劣质的香水和标签。但 50 美分对于一个年轻人来说已经很不错了。 你的世代、地位和条件。正如我所说，你是一位绅士。他们说需要三代人才能造就一位绅士。他们错了。金钱会像肥皂油脂一样光滑。它让你成为一位做作的绅士。这几乎成了我的一部分。我几乎和我两边的这两个Knickerbocker老绅士一样不礼貌、令人讨厌和无礼，他们晚上睡不着觉，因为我在他们中间买了东西。”</p>

                <p class="source">"There are some things that money can't accomplish," remarked young Rockwall, rather gloomily.</p>
                <p class="translate">“有些事情是金钱无法完成的，”年轻的Rockwall相当沮丧地说道。</p>

                <p class="source">"Now, don't say that," said old Anthony, shocked. "I bet my money on money every time. I've been through the encyclopaedia down to Y looking for something you can't buy with it; and I expect to have to take up the appendix next week. I'm for money against the field. Tell me something money won't buy."</p>
                <p class="translate">“现在，别这么说，”老Anthony震惊地说。 “我每次都把钱赌在金钱上。我已经翻阅了百科全书，一直在寻找用它买不到的东西；我预计下周必须讨论附录。我支持金钱对抗领域。告诉我一些金钱买不到的东西。”</p>

                <p class="source">"For one thing," answered Richard, rankling a little, "it won't buy one into the exclusive circles of society." "Oho! won't it?" thundered the champion of the root of evil. "You tell me where your exclusive circles would be if the first Astor hadn't had the money to pay for his steerage passage over?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“一方面，”Richard回答说，有点恼火，“它不会让一个人进入社会的专属圈子。” “噢！不会吧？” 邪恶之根的拥护者怒吼道。 “你告诉我，如果第一个Astor没有钱支付他的统舱费用，你的专属圈子会在哪里？”</p>

                <p class="source">Richard sighed.</p>
                <p class="translate">Richard叹了口气。</p>

                <p class="source">"And that's what I was coming to," said the old man, less boisterously. "That's why I asked you to come in. There's something going wrong with you, boy. I've been noticing it for two weeks. Out with it. I guess I could lay my hands on eleven millions within twenty-four hours, besides the real estate. If it's your liver, there's the Rambler down in the bay, coaled, and ready to steam down to the Bahamas in two days."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这就是我的目的，”老人说道，语气不那么喧闹了。 “这就是为什么我请你进来。你有问题，孩子。我已经注意到两个星期了。出去吧。除了房地产之外，我想我可以在二十四小时内拿到一千一百万。如果是你的肝脏，海湾里就有 Rambler，加了煤，准备在两天内驶往Bahamas。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Not a bad guess, dad; you haven't missed it far."</p>
                <p class="translate">“猜得不错，爸爸；你并没有错过太多。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Ah," said Anthony, keenly; "what's her name?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“啊，”Anthony敏锐地说。 “她叫什么名字？”</p>

                <p class="source">Richard began to walk up and down the library floor. There was enough comradeship and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his confidence.</p>
                <p class="translate">Richard开始在图书馆的地板上走来走去。 他这位粗鲁的老父亲身上有足够的情谊和同情心，足以赢得他的信任。</p>

                <p class="source">"Why don't you ask her?" demanded old Anthony. "She'll jump at you. You've got the money and the looks, and you're a decent boy. Your hands are clean. You've got no Eureka soap on 'em. You've been to college, but she'll overlook that."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你为什么不问问她？” 老Anthony问道。 “她会向你扑来。你有钱有貌，而且是个正派的男孩。你的手脚干净。你身上没有Eureka肥皂。你上过大学，但是她会忽略这一点。”</p>

                <p class="source">"I haven't had a chance," said Richard.</p>
                <p class="translate">“我没有机会，”Richard说。</p>

                <p class="source">"Make one," said Anthony. "Take her for a walk in the park, or a straw ride, or walk home with her from church Chance! Pshaw!"</p>
                <p class="translate">“造一个，”安东尼说。 “带她去公园散步，或者骑稻草车，或者和她从 Chance 教堂步行回家！噗！”</p>

                <p class="source">"You don't know the social mill, dad. She's part of the stream that turns it. Every hour and minute of her time is arranged for days in advance. I must have that girl, dad, or this town is a blackjack swamp forevermore. And I can't write it--I can't do that."</p>
                <p class="translate">“你不了解社交厂，爸爸。她是推动社会运转的溪流的一部分。她的每一小时每一分钟都是提前几天安排好的。我必须拥有那个女孩，爸爸，否则这个小镇永远就是一个二十一点沼泽。我写不出来 —— 我做不到。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Tut!" said the old man. "Do you mean to tell me that with all the money I've got you can't get an hour or two of a girl's time for yourself?"</p>
                <p class="translate">“啧！” 老人说道。 “你的意思是说，以我所有的钱，你也无法得到一个女孩的一两个小时的独处时间吗？”</p>

                <p class="source">"I've put it off too late. She's going to sail for Europe at noon day after to-morrow for a two years' stay. I'm to see her alone tomorrow evening for a few minutes. She's at Larchmont now at her aunt's. I can't go there. But I'm allowed to meet her with a cab at the Grand Central Station to-morrow evening at the 8.30 train. We drive down Broadway to Wallack's at a gallop, where her mother and a box party will be waiting for us in the lobby. Do you think she would listen to a declaration from me during that six or eight minutes under those circumstances? No. And what chance would I have in the theatre or afterward? None. No, dad, this is one tangle that your money can't unravel. We can't buy one minute of time with cash; if we could, rich people would live longer. There's no hope of getting a talk with Miss Lantry before she sails."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我推迟得太晚了。她后天中午就要启程去欧洲，在那里待两年。明天晚上我要单独见她几分钟。她现在在Larchmont。” 在她姨妈家。我不能去那里。但我被允许在明天晚上 8 点 30 分的火车上在大中央车站乘出租车去见她。我们沿着百老汇疾驰到Wallack家，她的母亲和 大厅里将会有一场包厢派对在等着我们。在这种情况下，你认为她会在那六八分钟内听我的声明吗？不会。那我在剧院或之后还有什么机会？不会。不会。 爸爸，这是你的钱无法解开的一个纠结。我们不能用现金买到一分钟的时间；如果可以的话，富人会活得更久。在Lantry小姐启程之前，没有希望与她交谈 ”。</p>

                <p class="source">"All right, Richard, my boy," said old Anthony, cheerfully. "You may run along down to your club now. I'm glad it ain't your liver. But don't forget to burn a few punk sticks in the joss house to the great god Mazuma from time to time. You say money won't buy time? Well, of course, you can't order eternity wrapped up and delivered at your residence for a price, but I've seen Father Time get pretty bad stone bruises on his heels when he walked through the gold diggings."</p>
                <p class="translate">“好吧，Richard，我的孩子，”老Anthony高兴地说。 “你现在可以跑去你的俱乐部了。我很高兴那不是你的肝脏。但是别忘了时不时地在庙里给伟大的Mazuma神烧几根朋克棒。你说钱买不到时间？好吧，当然，你不能以高价订购永恒的包裹并交付到你的住所，但我见过时间父亲在走过金矿时脚后跟受到了严重的石头瘀伤 ”。</p>

                <p class="source">That night came Aunt Ellen, gentle, sentimental, wrinkled, sighing, oppressed by wealth, in to Brother Anthony at his evening paper, and began discourse on the subject of lovers' woes.</p>
                <p class="translate">那天晚上，Ellen姨妈温柔、多愁善感，满脸皱纹，叹息着，饱受财富的压迫，来到Anthony弟兄面前，看他的晚报，开始谈论恋人的烦恼。</p>

                <p class="source">"He told me all about it," said brother Anthony, yawning. "I told him my bank account was at his service. And then he began to knock money. Said money couldn't help. Said the rules of society couldn't be bucked for a yard by a team of ten-millionaires."</p>
                <p class="translate">“他把这一切都告诉了我，”弟弟Anthony打着哈欠说道。 “我告诉他我的银行账户是为他服务的。然后他就开始敲着钱。说钱没用。说社会规则不能被千万富翁们违背。”</p>

                <p class="source">"Oh, Anthony," sighed Aunt Ellen, "I wish you would not think so much of money. Wealth is nothing where a true affection is concerned. Love is all-powerful. If he only had spoken earlier! She could not have refused our Richard. But now I fear it is too late. He will have no opportunity to address her. All your gold cannot bring happiness to your son."</p>
                <p class="translate">“哦，Anthony，”Ellen姨妈叹了口气，“我希望你不要把钱想得那么重要。对于真正的感情来说，财富根本不算什么。爱是万能的。要是他早点开口就好了！她不可能拒绝我们的Richard。但现在我担心为时已晚。他将没有机会向她讲话。你所有的金子都无法给你的儿子带来幸福。”</p>
