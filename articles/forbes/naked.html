                <h1>Naked</h1>
                <div class="author">China Forbes</div>
                <p class="indent">In the spring I was born naked. I was stuffed into a chamois cloth and presented to my mother.</p>
                <p class="indent">In the summer I was naked, stumbling over cold flat stones and cool, dew-laced grass until I tumbled giggling into my mother's arms. On the patio she sat with a book, sheltered by the weave of <span class="text-to-img" data-path="../imgs/wisteria.jpg">wisteria</span> that perfumed the air. Leaving the book open, face down on the white table that wobbled with the burden of lemonades, my mother looked down to me with violet eyes and smiled. We would chat while I stood on my favorite rock that came right up out of the patio floor. I held the iron pole beside it with one outstretched arm, and my other hand on my waist so with hip cocked to the side, I became Marilyn Monroe until I tired of it. Usually when I played Monroe I was in my suit, but not always. For in the summer I was mostly, freely, happily, obliviously naked.</p>
                <p class="indent">Our house was long and flat-roofed. It <abbr class="abbr" data-text="(of a river or road) follow a winding course.">meandered</abbr> down a sloping hill that was our front lawn. The lawn stretched on in every direction until it met with several different barriers: a wall of trees, a gravel drive, an apple orchard. My parents, sister and I were entirely <abbr class="abbr" data-text="sheltered and private.">secluded</abbr>, and I thought, self-sufficient. We rarely met with the outside world--save trips to the dump via <span class="text-to-img" data-path="../imgs/dq.png">Dairy Queen</span> with Dad. I was, therefore, immodest, and associated summer, early fall, and spring with nudity.</p>
                <p class="indent">In the fall, my older sister would go to school. She would wear her hair in two braids, put on dresses, and carry a lunch box. In the afternoons she came home with bright paintings under her arm, and stories about apple seeds. I would play in my toy box while she'd sit in the rocker and read.</p>
                <p class="indent">I was fascinated by the idea of school, of a place where my sister would go and always return with new things. When she left in the morning, she would walk importantly down the drive to Plympton Rd. where the school bus would pick her up. And on this particular morning, I was outside when she marched off to school. As she disappeared between the leaves, I started to follow, slowly keeping my distance. My bare, soft feet pressed into the gravel, and I was slightly chilled with goose bumps. It was a long drive, and I walked it without the air of determination my sister always had. I was curious. With my stomach poking out, I reached the mouth of the drive where the bus was just stopping. My sister turned and saw me standing there, mute and <abbr class="abbr" data-text="reluctant to draw attention to oneself; shy.">bashful</abbr>, and crackled. I looked into the bus, through the windows that reflected the turning leaves, and saw the huge, open mouths of the students, climbing over each other to get to the window, their bodies shaking, their faces pressed to the glass. As the door folded open, there was a burst of sound escaping suddenly like the whistle of stream from a kettle. Once my sister had stepped up into the bus, and the door had closed off  the noise, it pulled away. I hurried back up the drive, just until I was between the trees, just so long as I was inside the barrier.</p>
                <p class="indent">That was fourteen years ago. But last summer, I was naked. At eighteen I stepped out of hiding, on purpose.</p>
                <p class="indent">I had a boyfriend. As far as boyfriends go he was all right. He said a lot of nice things, made a lot of stupid mistakes, and was usually there when I wanted him to be. I suppose I loved him, though that's hard to say now. I used to say it all the time. It was an easy thing for me to yell after him as he left my doorstep. I never understood why my friends couldn't tell it to their boyfriends when they wanted to. It was a "stupid mistake" to speak the truth at the wrong time. I always stripped down as soon as I could. I just said it one day, he said it too, and we were happy.</p>
                <p class="indent">Then summer came. We were separeted by vacation plans. He was a counselor at a tennis camp, and I was living with my sister. For weeks we accepted our parting with optimism, like two children before Christmas, knowing it wouldn't be too long. I tried to hurry it along by taking a bus up to Vermont to see my Grandparents, who live near the camp. I told him I was coming, to take two days off. But when I got there, he couldn't get away. He had no transportation. He had no time off. We spoke on the phone from a distance of thirty miles.</p>
                <p class="indent">"I think we should break up," he said.</p>
                <p class="indent">"What?"</p>
                <p class="indent">"It's ridiculous to keep this up. I never see you."</p>
                <p class="indent">"That's your fault."</p>
                <p class="indent">"Maybe."</p>
                <p class="indent">"I can't believe you're saying this. Over the phone."</p>
                <p class="indent">"How else could I? I never see you... I can't love someone I never see."</p>
                <p class="indent">"Right."</p>
                <p class="indent">"I'm going to be in California for four years, we'll never be together for more than three or four days again. Do you want that?"</p>
                <p class="indent">I was crying.</p>
                <p class="indent">"Look, I've gotta go, it's 6:30. Dinner."</p>
                <p class="indent">"Uh huh."</p>
                <p class="indent">"I'm gonna go."</p>
                <p class="indent">After two days I wrote a letter. I mailed it the day I left for Europe. It was eight pages of words I had never been able to say to him; more than "I love you." They explained things, told him exactly how I felt. They were soft words, and so honest that I surprised myself. They remembered times we spent in high school, waiting to graduate together. They were sad words, admitting the loss I felt. They told him he was right. And they told him I still loved him.</p>
                <p class="indent">In three weeks I got back from Europe. There was no letter.</p>
                <p class="indent">This fall, sitting between the pillows on the futon, my roommates discussed art. We were hanging posters and I tacked up <span class="text-to-img" data-path="../imgs/matisse.jpg">Matisse postcards</span> on my bulletin board: a woman reclines on a chaise lounge in red harem pants, naked from the waist up. The walls of the room are orange and yellow flowers, and a blue and white patterned screen surrounds her. Her hands are behind her head and she is resting, calm. One roommate caught sight of a bared breast, and stopped.</p>
                <p class="indent">"What is that?"</p>
                <p class="indent">"What?"</p>
                <p class="indent">"That's naked!"</p>
                <p class="indent">"I know it's naked. Haven't you seen a nude before?"</p>
                <p class="indent">"Not in a painting. I've seen myself."</p>
                <p class="indent">"You've never seen nude painting? Aren't there museums in Newfoundland?"</p>
                <p class="indent">"Yes, but they don't exhibit that."</p>
                <p class="indent">"But it's important, it's beautiful."</p>
                <p class="indent">"That's not beautiful, it's disgusting."</p>
                <p class="indent">"It's art."</p>
                <p class="indent">"It's disgusting."</p>
                <p class="indent">I wondered if I had unconsciously taped the <abbr class="abbr" data-text="the two middle pages of a magazine, often taken up by a single illustration or feature; typically a picture of a naked or scantily clad model.">centerfold</abbr> on my wall.</p>
                <p class="indent">I see others carefully covering up their tracks like criminals, spreading the dust thin over the unique grooves they refuse to leave behind. They twist words into measured speeches, keeping silent the taboo feelings. They do it out of fear. They do it out of habit. They learn it young on school buses. They create barriers and never cross them. Because when we see nudity, when we hear nudity, we turn away, close the door to the dressing room in awkward haste or simple ridicule. So I keep reminding myself: I was born naked. I was born naked.</p>
