                <p class="source">The last time I saw my mother at her home, it was July, a Sunday. I travelled there by train. At Motteville, we sat in the station for a long time. It was hot. It was quiet, both in the compartment and outside. I looked out the open window; the platform was empty. On the other side of the S.N.C.F. railroad barriers, the tall grass almost touched the lowest branches of the apple trees. It was then that I could really feel that I was approaching C. and that I was going to see my mother. The train continued on to C. at a reduced speed.</p>
                <p class="translate">我最后一次在家见到母亲，是七月的一个周日。 我乘火车去那里。 在Motteville（莫特维尔），我们在车站坐了很长时间。无论是车厢内还是车厢外，都很安静，都很热。 我向开着的窗外望去； 站台上空无一人。 在 S.N.C.F. 铁路护栏的另一边，高高的草几乎碰到了苹果树最低的树枝。 就在那时，我真正感觉到我正在接近C.，我即将见到我的母亲。 火车继续以降低的速度开往 C.。</p>

                <p class="source">Leaving the station, I thought I recognized various faces, without being able to put a name to any of them. Perhaps I had never known the names. It was less hot, thanks to the wind. It's always windy in C. Everyone, including my mother, believes that it's colder in C. than in other places, even those just five kilometres away.</p>
                <p class="translate">离开车站后，我想我认出了不同的面孔，但无法说出他们中任何一个的名字。 也许我从来不知道这些名字。 由于有风，天气不那么热了。 C 总是刮风。每个人，包括我妈妈，都认为 C 比其他地方冷，甚至比那些只有五公里远的地方还要冷。</p>

                <p class="source">I didn't take the taxi that was parked in front of the railway hotel, as I would have anywhere else. As soon as I'm in C., I go back to my old ways: a taxi is for communions, weddings, and burials. There's no reason to spend money like that. I headed up Rue Carnot, to the town center. At the first pâtisserie, I bought cakes, éclairs, and apple tarts—the kind she used to tell me to bring home after midday Mass. I bought some flowers, too, gladioli, which last a long time. Until I got to the housing complex where she lives, I didn't think anything besides, I'm going to see her again and She's waiting for me.</p>
                <p class="translate">我没有乘坐停在铁路酒店前面的出租车，就像我在其他地方一样。 一到C.，我就又回到原来的方式：乘坐出租车是用于圣餐、婚礼和葬礼。 没有理由这么花钱。 我沿着卡诺街前往市中心。 在第一家糕点店，我买了蛋糕、闪电泡芙和苹果馅饼 —— 她以前叫我在中午弥撒后带回家的那种。我还买了一些花，剑兰，可以保存很长时间。 直到我到达她住的小区，我什么也没想，只是我要再见到她，她正在等我。</p>

                <p class="source">I knocked on the narrow door of her ground-floor studio apartment. She called out, "Yes. Come in!"</p>
                <p class="translate">我敲了敲她一楼单间公寓的窄门。 她喊道：“哎，进来吧！”</p>

                <p class="source">"You should lock the door!"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你应该锁门！”</p>

                <p class="source">"I knew it was you. There's no one else it could have been."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我就知道是你。不可能有其他人。”</p>

                <p class="source">She was apronless, with lipstick on, laughing, standing by the table. She put her hand on my shoulder, tilting her face up for me to kiss. At the same time, she was firing off questions about my trip, the children, the dog. She didn't answer mine. Afraid of being boring, always, when speaking of herself. Later, she repeated, as usual, "I'm fine here. Couldn't be better" and "I have no complaints." The TV was on without sound, just the test pattern on the screen.</p>
                <p class="translate">她没穿围裙，涂着口红，站在桌边笑着。 她把手放在我的肩上，仰起脸让我亲吻。 与此同时，她不断地询问有关我的旅行、孩子和狗的问题。 她没有回答我的问题。 当谈论自己时，总是害怕变得无聊。 后来，她像往常一样重复道：“我在这里很好。再好不过了”和“我没有任何抱怨。” 电视开着，没有声音，只有屏幕上的测试图案。</p>

                <p class="source">She took the gladioli, a little uneasy, and thanked me with an artificial tone to her voice. I had forgotten: my giving her flowers from a florist had always seemed like an affectation to her, too formal; it hurt her feelings. It was as if I were fussing over her as I would over a stranger, not family. The cakes pleased her, but she had already bought some for us on her way back from Mass.</p>
                <p class="translate">她有些不安地接过剑兰花，用不自然的语气向我表示感谢。 我忘记了：我从花店送花给她，在她看来一直是一种矫揉造作，太正式了； 这伤害了她的感情。 就好像我对她大惊小怪，就像对一个陌生人而不是家人一样。 这些蛋糕让她很满意，但她在弥撒回来的路上已经给我们买了一些。</p>

                <p class="source">We sat opposite each other at the table that, along with the buffet, almost filled her apartment. I remembered what she'd said the first time I'd come here after she moved in: "I bought it big—it can seat at least ten people!" Not once, in six years. . . . Nevertheless, she had covered it with an oilcloth, so as not to damage it.</p>
                <p class="translate">我们面对面坐在桌子旁，这张桌子和自助餐一起几乎占满了她的公寓。 我记得她搬进来后，我第一次来的时候，她是这么说的：“我买的很大，至少能坐十个人！” 没有一次，六年了。 。 。 。 不过，她还是用油布盖住了它，以免损坏它。</p>

                <p class="source">She was breathless, as though she had no idea where to start among all the things we had to talk about. It was dark in her studio, and there was a slight odor; she didn't air it out enough. When I was a child, she'd take me with her to visit some old ladies on Sundays. Leaving their houses, she'd sniff the air: "It always smells so musty in old people's homes—they never open the windows." Because she used to say this, I hadn't expected her to become one of those people.</p>
                <p class="translate">她气喘吁吁，似乎不知道在我们必须谈论的所有事情中从哪里开始。 她的工作室里漆黑一片，还有轻微的气味。 她没有把这件事宣扬得足够多。 当我还是个孩子的时候，她会在周日带我去拜访一些老太太。 离开他们的房子的时候，她闻了闻空气：“老人家里总是有股霉味 —— 他们从不打开窗户。” 因为她曾经说过这样的话，所以我没想到她会成为那些人中的一员。</p>

                <p class="source">She talked about the weather in C. in the spring and the people who had died since my last visit, getting irritated with my failure to remember them, which she felt was intentional—"It's that you don't want to remember." Giving me detail after detail, until I could figure out whom she meant: the person lived there, her daughter went to school with me, and so on.</p>
                <p class="translate">她谈到了春天里C.的天气，以及自从我上次访问以来死去的人，对我不记得他们感到恼火，她觉得这是故意的 —— “是你不想记住。” 给我一个又一个的细节，直到我明白她指的是谁：那个人住在那里，她的女儿和我一起上学，等等。</p>
