                <p class="source">The last time I saw my mother at her home, it was July, a Sunday. I travelled there by train. At Motteville, we sat in the station for a long time. It was hot. It was quiet, both in the compartment and outside. I looked out the open window; the platform was empty. On the other side of the S.N.C.F. railroad barriers, the tall grass almost touched the lowest branches of the apple trees. It was then that I could really feel that I was approaching C. and that I was going to see my mother. The train continued on to C. at a reduced speed.</p>
                <p class="translate">我最后一次在家见到母亲，是七月的一个周日。 我乘火车去那里。 在Motteville（莫特维尔），我们在车站坐了很长时间。无论是车厢内还是车厢外，都很安静，都很热。 我向开着的窗外望去； 站台上空无一人。 在 S.N.C.F. 铁路护栏的另一边，高高的草几乎碰到了苹果树最低的树枝。 就在那时，我真正感觉到我正在接近C.，我即将见到我的母亲。 火车继续以降低的速度开往 C.。</p>

                <p class="source">Leaving the station, I thought I recognized various faces, without being able to put a name to any of them. Perhaps I had never known the names. It was less hot, thanks to the wind. It's always windy in C. Everyone, including my mother, believes that it's colder in C. than in other places, even those just five kilometres away.</p>
                <p class="translate">离开车站后，我想我认出了不同的面孔，但无法说出他们中任何一个的名字。 也许我从来不知道这些名字。 由于有风，天气不那么热了。 C 总是刮风。每个人，包括我妈妈，都认为 C 比其他地方冷，甚至比那些只有五公里远的地方还要冷。</p>

                <p class="source">I didn't take the taxi that was parked in front of the railway hotel, as I would have anywhere else. As soon as I'm in C., I go back to my old ways: a taxi is for communions, weddings, and burials. There's no reason to spend money like that. I headed up Rue Carnot, to the town center. At the first pâtisserie, I bought cakes, éclairs, and apple tarts—the kind she used to tell me to bring home after midday Mass. I bought some flowers, too, gladioli, which last a long time. Until I got to the housing complex where she lives, I didn't think anything besides, I'm going to see her again and She's waiting for me.</p>
                <p class="translate">我没有乘坐停在铁路酒店前面的出租车，就像我在其他地方一样。 一到C.，我就又回到原来的方式：乘坐出租车是用于圣餐、婚礼和葬礼。 没有理由这么花钱。 我沿着卡诺街前往市中心。 在第一家糕点店，我买了蛋糕、闪电泡芙和苹果馅饼 —— 她以前叫我在中午弥撒后带回家的那种。我还买了一些花，剑兰，可以保存很长时间。 直到我到达她住的小区，我什么也没想，只是我要再见到她，她正在等我。</p>

                <p class="source">I knocked on the narrow door of her ground-floor studio apartment. She called out, "Yes. Come in!"</p>
                <p class="translate">我敲了敲她一楼单间公寓的窄门。 她喊道：“哎，进来吧！”</p>

                <p class="source">"You should lock the door!"</p>
                <p class="translate">“你应该锁门！”</p>

                <p class="source">"I knew it was you. There's no one else it could have been."</p>
                <p class="translate">“我就知道是你。不可能有其他人。”</p>

                <p class="source">She was apronless, with lipstick on, laughing, standing by the table. She put her hand on my shoulder, tilting her face up for me to kiss. At the same time, she was firing off questions about my trip, the children, the dog. She didn't answer mine. Afraid of being boring, always, when speaking of herself. Later, she repeated, as usual, "I'm fine here. Couldn't be better" and "I have no complaints." The TV was on without sound, just the test pattern on the screen.</p>
                <p class="translate">她没穿围裙，涂着口红，站在桌边笑着。 她把手放在我的肩上，仰起脸让我亲吻。 与此同时，她不断地询问有关我的旅行、孩子和狗的问题。 她没有回答我的问题。 当谈论自己时，总是害怕变得无聊。 后来，她像往常一样重复道：“我在这里很好。再好不过了”和“我没有任何抱怨。” 电视开着，没有声音，只有屏幕上的测试图案。</p>

                <p class="source">She took the gladioli, a little uneasy, and thanked me with an artificial tone to her voice. I had forgotten: my giving her flowers from a florist had always seemed like an affectation to her, too formal; it hurt her feelings. It was as if I were fussing over her as I would over a stranger, not family. The cakes pleased her, but she had already bought some for us on her way back from Mass.</p>
                <p class="translate">她有些不安地接过剑兰花，用不自然的语气向我表示感谢。 我忘记了：我从花店送花给她，在她看来一直是一种矫揉造作，太正式了； 这伤害了她的感情。 就好像我对她大惊小怪，就像对一个陌生人而不是家人一样。 这些蛋糕让她很满意，但她在弥撒回来的路上已经给我们买了一些。</p>

                <p class="source">We sat opposite each other at the table that, along with the buffet, almost filled her apartment. I remembered what she'd said the first time I'd come here after she moved in: "I bought it big—it can seat at least ten people!" Not once, in six years. . . . Nevertheless, she had covered it with an oilcloth, so as not to damage it.</p>
                <p class="translate">我们面对面坐在桌子旁，这张桌子和自助餐一起几乎占满了她的公寓。 我记得她搬进来后，我第一次来的时候，她是这么说的：“我买的很大，至少能坐十个人！” 没有一次，六年了。 。 。 。 不过，她还是用油布盖住了它，以免损坏它。</p>

                <p class="source">She was breathless, as though she had no idea where to start among all the things we had to talk about. It was dark in her studio, and there was a slight odor; she didn't air it out enough. When I was a child, she'd take me with her to visit some old ladies on Sundays. Leaving their houses, she'd sniff the air: "It always smells so musty in old people's homes—they never open the windows." Because she used to say this, I hadn't expected her to become one of those people.</p>
                <p class="translate">她气喘吁吁，似乎不知道在我们必须谈论的所有事情中从哪里开始。 她的工作室里漆黑一片，还有轻微的气味。 她没有把这件事宣扬得足够多。 当我还是个孩子的时候，她会在周日带我去拜访一些老太太。 离开他们的房子的时候，她闻了闻空气：“老人家里总是有股霉味 —— 他们从不打开窗户。” 因为她曾经说过这样的话，所以我没想到她会成为那些人中的一员。</p>

                <p class="source">She talked about the weather in C. in the spring and the people who had died since my last visit, getting irritated with my failure to remember them, which she felt was intentional—"It's that you don't want to remember." Giving me detail after detail, until I could figure out whom she meant: the person lived there, her daughter went to school with me, and so on.</p>
                <p class="translate">她谈到了春天里C.的天气，以及自从我上次访问以来死去的人，对我不记得他们感到恼火，她觉得这是故意的 —— “是你不想记住。” 给我一个又一个的细节，直到我明白她指的是谁：那个人住在那里，她的女儿和我一起上学，等等。</p>
                
                <p class="source">We set the table at quarter to twelve. The last time, she'd waited until twelve-thirty. She was accelerating everything. At one point, she said that the days of beautiful weather would soon be over.</p>
                <p class="translate">我们把桌子定在十二点一刻。 上次，她等到了十二点三十分。 她正在加速一切。 有一次，她说好天气的日子很快就会结束。</p>

                <p class="source">While looking for napkins, I found a stack of romance magazines at the back of the buffet. I didn't say anything about them, but she guessed that I'd seen them. "Those little magazines—Paulette gives them to me, otherwise you know I wouldn't read them. That's all she reads, these little stories about nothing." Still afraid that I'd criticize her reading habits. I almost said that it didn't matter if she preferred Nous Deux to the Malraux she'd just borrowed from the public library. She would have been unhappy if I'd seemed to think her incapable of reading the kind of thing I read.</p>
                <p class="translate">在寻找餐巾纸时，我在自助餐台后面发现了一叠浪漫杂志。 我没有说任何关于它们的事，但她猜我见过它们。 “那些小杂志——Paulette把它们给了我，否则你知道我不会读它们。这就是她读的全部内容，这些毫无内容的小故事。” 还是担心我会批评她的阅读习惯。 我几乎要说，如果她更喜欢《Nous Deux》而不是她刚从公共图书馆借来的《Malraux》，那并不重要。 如果我似乎认为她无法阅读我读过的那种东西，她会不高兴的。</p>

                <p class="source">The meal passed in silence. Her eyes on her plate, her slightly sloppy movements those of someone used to eating alone. She refused to let me do the dishes. "What will there be for me to do once you leave?"</p>
                <p class="translate">这顿饭在沉默中过去了。 她的眼睛盯着盘子，动作有些草率，就像习惯一个人吃饭的人一样。 她拒绝让我洗碗。 “你走了之后我要做什么？”</p>

                <p class="source">She was sitting up straight in her chair, her arms crossed. I'd never seen her move her body in a natural, relaxed way; she never ran her fingers gently through her hair, never slipped a hand inside the neckline of her blouse while deep in a book. Her only gestures of abandon were expressions of fatigue: stretching with her arms above her head, slumping in a chair, her legs out in front of her. Less hardness in her face than there had been, less of that tension you need to make your way through life. Her gray eyes, which had always suspected the worst of me, were fixed on me with a hungry softness. She had been counting the days, had told herself in the morning that this was the day I was coming, and there we were, the two of us, and half our time had already passed. The tone of our visit was playful and kind. The other tone, the violence from when I was fifteen, would not return. "Cow, bitch, I'm killing myself for her." "I'm going to get the fuck out of here." "You're going to jail first, you useless idiot."</p>
                <p class="translate">她在椅子上坐得笔直，双臂交叉。 我从未见过她以自然、放松的方式移动身体；她的动作很自然。 她从来不会用手指轻轻地梳理头发，也不会在埋头读书时把手伸进衬衫领口。 她唯一的放弃姿态是疲倦的表情：双臂伸过头顶，瘫坐在椅子上，双腿伸在身前。 她脸上的表情比以前少了一些，也少了你生活所需的紧张。 她那双灰色的眼睛一直怀疑我最坏的一面，现在却以一种饥饿的温柔盯着我。 她一直在数着日子，早上告诉自己，这就是我要来的日子，我们就在那里，我们两个人，我们的时间已经过去了一半。 我们访问的基调是俏皮而友善的。 另一种语气，在我十五岁时的暴力语气，再也不会出现了。 “牛啊，贱人，我要为她自杀了。” “我他妈要离开这里。” “你先进监狱吧，你这个没用的白痴。”</p>

                <p class="source">She tried to come up with more subjects of conversation, so that I wouldn't go too soon, leaving her alone with her desire for me, her longing to live with me, her daughter, forever. "Paulette brought me some gooseberries. You wouldn't believe how good they are. It makes sense, since they're in season. Remind me to give you some before you go." Paulette—a former neighbor who was my age—came to see her every week; she had never left C.</p>
                <p class="translate">她试图想出更多的话题，这样我就不会太早离开，留下她独自一人，表达她对我的渴望，她渴望与我，她的女儿，永远生活在一起。 “Paulette给我带来了一些醋栗。你不会相信它们有多好。这是有道理的，因为它们正是时令。在你走之前提醒我给你一些。” Paulette——一位与我同龄的前邻居——每周都会来看望她。 她从未离开过C。</p>

                <p class="source">I could hear cars in the distance on the trunk road, a radio in the apartment next door, broadcasting the Tour de France, perhaps.</p>
                <p class="translate">我能听到远处主干道上的汽车声，隔壁公寓里的收音机，也许正在广播环法自行车赛。</p>

                <p class="source">"It's peaceful."</p>
                <p class="translate">“很平静。”</p>

                <p class="source">"It's always peaceful here. Sundays are the quietest."</p>
                <p class="translate">“这里总是很安静。周日是最安静的。”</p>

                <p class="source">Many times she had advised me to get some rest during my vacation. The sentence that used to horrify me the most when I was complaining that I didn't know what to do: "Just have a little rest." Again, I felt the onset of annoyance, but her words had no power over me anymore. They only reawakened memories, the way sports radio on Sunday or an apple tart can. I could feel the boredom of summers in C.: reading from morning to night; Sunday movies, restricted or for adults only, in the three-quarters-empty theatre of the Mondial, while she thought I was out for a "nice walk" with an older cousin; the children's games at the street fair for local businesses; the public dance hall, which I didn't dare enter.</p>
                <p class="translate">她多次劝我在假期期间好好休息。 当我抱怨自己不知道该做什么时，最让我恐惧的一句话是：“休息一下吧。” 我再次感到恼火，但她的话已经不再对我产生影响了。 它们只会重新唤醒记忆，就像周日的体育广播或苹果馅饼一样。 我能感受到C.夏天的无聊：从早到晚读书； 周日，在Mondial四分之三空荡荡的剧院里看电影，仅限成人观看，而她以为我是在和一位年长的表亲出去“愉快地散步”； 街头集市上为当地企业举办的儿童游戏； 公共舞厅，我不敢进去。</p>

                <p class="source">In the middle of the afternoon, a cat appeared on the windowsill of the kitchenette. She jumped up from her armchair to let it in, an "adopted" cat that she fed, that slept on her bed in the daytime. She was the happiest she'd been since I got there. The cat kept us busy for a long time—watching it, taking turns holding it. She recounted all its tricks; "the little pig" clawed the curtains, and even her wrists, which were striped with red in two places. As she used to, she said, "Every living thing is beautiful." She seemed to have forgotten that I was going to leave.</p>
                <p class="translate">下午，小厨房的窗台上出现了一只猫。 她从扶手椅上跳起来，让它进来，这是一只她喂养的“领养”猫，白天睡在她的床上。 自从我到达那里以来，她是最幸福的。 那只猫让我们忙了很长一段时间——看着它，轮流抱着它。 她讲述了所有的伎俩； “小猪”抓破了窗帘，甚至抓破了她的手腕，手腕上有两处红色条纹。 正如她以前所说，“每一个生物都是美丽的。” 她似乎忘记了我要离开。</p>

                <p class="source">At the last minute, she pulled out a form that urgently needed to be filled out for her Social Security. "I don't have time. Just give it to me and I'll send it to you." "It'll take no time. You're five minutes from the station." "I'll miss my train." "You've never missed it. You can take the next one." She was on the verge of tears. She concluded with her habitual "This is very upsetting for me."</p>
                <p class="translate">在最后一刻，她拿出了一份急需填写的社会保障表格。 “我没时间，你给我吧，我发给你。” “不用花时间。你离车站只有五分钟的路程。” “我会错过火车的。” “你从来没有错过过。你可以选择下一趟。” 她快要哭了。 她以惯常的方式总结道：“这让我非常沮丧。”</p>

                <p class="source">After kissing me at the door, she tried to keep talking. Last image of her: in the doorway, rounded arms framing her heavy silhouette in a yellow dress—her prettiest one, tight around the chest and the belly—a wide, fixed smile. This time, once again, I felt that I was leaving badly, in a cowardly way.</p>
                <p class="translate">在门口吻了我之后，她试图继续说话。 她的最后一张照片：在门口，圆圆的手臂勾勒出她穿着黄色连衣裙的沉重轮廓——她最漂亮的那件，紧紧地包裹着胸部和腹部——脸上挂着灿烂而坚定的微笑。 这一次，我再一次感到自己的离开很糟糕，而且很懦弱。</p>

                <p class="source">I took the shortest route to the train, the one that goes past the Shell station. There, in the old days, I'd stop to prepare myself for her interrogating look when I returned from the cinema, bracing myself, wiping off what was left of my lipstick. What will people think of you?</p>
                <p class="translate">我选择了去火车站的最短路线，即经过壳牌油站的那条路线。 以前，当我从电影院回来时，我会停下来准备迎接她审问的表情，振作起来，擦掉残留的口红。 人们会怎么看你？</p>

                <p class="source">On the train, I couldn't help imagining her, washing the dishes in a solitary silence, all sign of my presence soon erased. I watched C. disappear—the Sernam buildings, the railway workers' housing beside the tracks.</p>
                <p class="translate">在火车上，我情不自禁地想象着她在孤独的沉默中洗碗，我在场的所有迹象很快就消失了。 我看着 C. 消失了 —— Sernam大楼、铁轨旁的铁路工人住房。</p>

                <p class="source">A month later, I came back to see my mother. She had suffered sunstroke after Mass and had been admitted to the hospital in C. I aired out her apartment, retrieved paperwork from her buffet, threw out the perishables in her fridge. In the vegetable drawer, in a plastic bag that was knotted at the top, were the gooseberries I had forgotten to take the previous time, now just a brown, liquid heap.</p>
                <p class="translate">一个月后，我回来看妈妈。 她在弥撒后中暑，住进了 C 的医院。我给她的公寓通风，从她的自助餐中取出文件，扔掉冰箱里的易腐烂的东西。 蔬菜抽屉里有一个顶部打结的塑料袋，里面装着我上次忘记带的醋栗，现在只剩下一堆棕色的液体。</p>
